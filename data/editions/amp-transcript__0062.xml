                        In his 1973 review of <hi rend="italic">English Biblical Translation</hi> by A. C. Partridge Deutsch, "Renderings", <rs type="person" ref="#amp_person_1">Auden</rs> refers to the "as yet incomplete, <rs type="lit_work" ref="#lit_work_id_198">Anchor Bible</rs>". He claims that he owes an "increased understanding" of the "version of the Scriptures I was brought up on" to the "scholarly introductions" therein (587-588). To the knowledge of Auden's literary executor <rs type="person" ref="#amp_person_98">Edward Mendelson</rs>, Auden did not review any volumes of the <rs type="lit_work" ref="#lit_work_id_198">Anchor Bible Series</rs>.

                        The personal memoir of Auden's Austrian acquaintance Franz Kaisergruber, principal of the Böheimkirchen secondary school, recalls <rs type="person" ref="#amp_person_1">Auden</rs> issuing a cheque worth 450 dollars to support the son of a friend (released from his duties because of his membership in the National Socialist party) of Kaisergruber's. The 18-year-old was planning to attend the <rs type="org" ref="#amp_organization_56">Technical University in Vienna</rs> to become an engineer. According to Kaisergruber, Auden continued his support of the family for many years (2).
