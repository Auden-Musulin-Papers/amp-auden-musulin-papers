                  <space quantity="5" unit="char"/>Half an hour from the outskirts of Vienna an invisible<lb/>
                  thread bisect<del>x</del>s the motorway. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>It leads from the church which<lb/>
                  lies to the north, more accurately speaking from the churchyard,<lb/>
                  disregards entirely the traffic as it thunders to and from the<lb/>
                  capital, wriggles across a field to the south, passes a small<lb/>
                  house which was once a garage. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>Up a steep path, plum trees<lb/>
                  on one side and apple trees on the other, through a wicket<lb/>
                  gate, and now the thread, which has turned neither to right nor<lb/>
                  left, has reached its objective: <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>a long, low house, more an<lb/>
                  extended workman's cottage. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>Originally, the address was<lb/>
                  Hinterhol<del>6</del>z 6<unclear>;</unclear>  <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>later, the lane up from the village on the other<lb/>
                  side was renamed Auden-<del>A</del>Strasse. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>This thread or unseen line joins<lb/>
                  the places where Auden prayed, sang (flat) and was buried, and<lb/>
                  the place where he lived, and to me it is tangible reality,<lb/>
                  unfailingly sensed at each frequent crossing. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>Partly it is<lb/>
                  because it was alwa<del>s</del>ys from that direction that I arrived, being<lb/>
                  mistrustful of the narrow lane which lies along the top of the<lb/>
                  garden and leads into a wood where in a small clearing floored<lb/>
                  at times by sticky mud, the car can be turned. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/><unclear>I</unclear>t seemed<lb/>
                  preferable, and anyway became a habit, to take the cart track<lb/>
                  <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>through the field with its ruts, the depth of which left the<lb/>
                  undercarriage to slide along the plateau of coarse grass. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>And<lb/>
                  to leave the car by the garage and plod up through the orchard,<lb/>
                  accepting the risk of slithering off the path to the right.<lb/>
                  <space quantity="5" unit="char"/>On walking through the wicket-gate next to the woodshed,<lb/>
                  there has been from time to time, and is today, the risk of<lb/>
                  being savaged by a wall-eyed dog; <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>in earlier days, of having<lb/>
                  to account for ones presence to Frau Emma. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>Past the vegetable<lb/>
                  patch, now the ground levels off and the house stands before us.<lb/>
                  Left, at the foot of the outside staircase and below the window of<lb/>
                  his workroom, there are the white table and comfortable garden<lb/>
                  chairs with red cushions. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>Facing the caller, the green door with<lb/>
                  a bell, the sort which jangles when pulled. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>I seldom did so,<lb/>
                  feeling that its clamour spoke of altogether too much aggressive<lb/>
                  jocularity. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>Seeing the light through the sittingroom window, it was<lb/>
                  better to walk straight in to the small entrance hall - coats hanging

               <p>
                  on the wall ahead, kitchen through the right-hand door, a clutter<lb/>
                  of books and papers on a nearby ledge - and to shout. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>That<lb/>
                  heartwarming bellow from Wystan: <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>"Ah!" and here is the familiar<lb/>
                  scene, we are enveloped in the unchanging fug. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>The shelves<lb/>
                  of re<del>f</del>cords and the oversized record player on the left, the<lb/>
                  big, square dining table with its food-stained cloth. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>Centre<lb/>
                  back, the Austrian peasant cupboard containing drinks, sugar,<lb/>
                  salt, then the corner seat, the table with its cigarette burns<lb/>
                  and glass rings, and two arm-chairs - a <hi rend="underline">Sitzecke.</hi> <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>To our right<lb/>
                  a tumble of assorted titles on an invisible surface; <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>within a<lb/>
                  matter of days, Auden could make a new book look like a lending<lb/>
                  library reject: <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>the content was all, the package irrelevant.<lb/>
                  Here lie, precariously balanced, collapsing, upended, volumes of<lb/>
                  poetry, cookery books, Benson's Lucia novels, Akenfield, whodunnits<lb/>
                  a new translation of the Bible. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>Over the years, the content of<lb/>
                  the heap varied but the overall appearance scarcely at all.<lb/>
                  And now the stove, country style, a white dome with round green<lb/>
                  tiles set in it, one of the glories of Austrian <hi rend="underline">Wohnkultur</hi>.<lb/>
                  How fortunate that the stove is irremovable, or it would be in<lb/>
                  Athens now, along with the cupboard and the original drawings of<lb/>
                  Stravinsky and Richard Strauss. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>Books also lie along the top<lb/>
                  ledge of the corner seat, and a volume or two of the OED on the<lb/>
                  upright chairs by the dinner table, adjuncts to the Times<lb/>
                  crossword. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>Was it, I asked, essential to have the complete<lb/>
                  Oxford English Dictionary, all thirteen volumes of it, at each<lb/>
                  of ones residences? <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>"Of cour<del>x</del>se" said Auden, surprised at such a<lb/>
                  question.<lb/>
                  <space quantity="5" unit="char"/>So much was written during his lifetime about Auden's<lb/>
                  way of life in Kirchstetten: <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>articles by capable journalists<lb/>
                  in the Sunday papers and in their weekly magazines, that any<lb/>
                  attempt at a personal memoir gives the writer the feeling that<lb/>
                  he is working all too well-trodden ground.<lb/>
                  <space quantity="5" unit="char"/>It is not only that the scene is familiar. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>What can a friend<lb/>
                  write withou<del>g</del>t lapsing into triviality and gossip, without calling<lb/>
                  down on his head the wrath of Wystan Auden himself, about whom,

               <p>
                  if we know nothing else, we realise the obsession that he had<lb/>
                  on the subject of personal privacy. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>Think <del>of</del>for a moment of<lb/>
                  "Forewords and Afterwords": <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>again and again he writes on<lb/>
                  these lines: <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>Of Wagner: <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>"On principle, I object to biographies<lb/>
                  of artists, since <unclear>I</unclear> do not believe that knowledge of their<lb/>
                  private lives <del>t</del>sheds any significant light upon their works."<lb/>
                  And on Oscar Wilde: <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>"Since know<del>o</del>ledge of an artist's private li<del>r</del>fe<lb/>
                  never throws any significant light upon his work, there is no<lb/>
                  justification for intruding upon his privacy." <space quantity="2" unit="char"/>Listening to<lb/>
                  Kurt Weill records one winter's evening in Chester's flat in the<lb/>
                  Esslarngasse, I asked him whether he could account for it.<lb/>
                  Disappointingly, Chester only said that it was an obsession with<lb/>
                  Wystan, a<del>j</del>n individual phobia like any other. <space quantity="2" unit="char"/>The only time that<lb/>
                  Auden ever came near to snapping at me was when he spoke once,<lb/>
                  affectionately, of Tolkien, saying that he was to speak or write<lb/>
                  about him. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>Was he, I asked, going to say anything at all about<lb/>
                  the man as the creator of the world of Tolkien, of the Lord of the<lb/>
                  Rings<del>,</del>? <del>and</del> <del>h</del>He said "Certainly not! <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>I shouldn't dream of saying<lb/>
                  anything about Tolkien himself." <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>So that the predicament is<lb/>
                  understood : <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>either we keep silent when asked to speak <del>o</del>and write<lb/>
                  about Auden, which might seem a trifle portentous, not to say<lb/>
                  uncivil. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>Or <del>w</del>else we run the dual risk of trivi<del>li</del><unclear>a</unclear>lity or indiscretio<unclear>n.</unclear><lb/>
                  In the eyes of <del>those</del>other<unclear>s</unclear> who knew him <del>best</del>better, there is probably a<lb/>
                  further risk, that of being couple<unclear>d</unclear> with the German mythical<lb/>
                  figure, the hor<del>e</del>seman who rode, as he supposed, over the frozen<lb/>
                  Lake of Constance, unaware that this was not the case at all, but<lb/>
                  he was being carried along above dark waters, knowing nothing<lb/>
                  of the treacherous depths beneath him. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>So that my contribution<lb/>
                  can be <del><unclear>m</unclear></del>no more than an attempt to show how Auden lived among the<lb/>
                  Austrians, on what sort of terms he was with them, and perhaps<lb/>
                  to fill in one or two gaps in what is generally known.<lb/>
                  <space quantity="5" unit="char"/>I got to know Wystan and Chester through <del>Chris</del> the daughter<lb/>
                  of Hugo von Hofmannsthal, Christiane Zimmer, who was a friend of<lb/>
                  Auden's in New York. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>Gerty von Hofmannsthal, widow of the poet, who died in 1929,<lb/>
                  owned Sch<del>,</del>loss Prielau at the northern tip of the lake of Zell-<lb/>
                  am-See in Salzburg province. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>She had been forced to sell when the<lb/>

                  turn of the fifties, and t<del>e</del>here she spent her summers until she<lb/>
                  died, filling the house with her friends, often like herself Anglo-Austrian<lb/>
                  émigrés - the writers, artists and scholars who had lived and<lb/>
                  worked in Vienna during the twilight of that great explosion of<lb/>
                  talent which coincided with the decline and end of the Austro-<lb/>
                  Hungarian Empire. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>Raimund and Liz von Hofmannsthal were often<lb/>
                  there, with their children Arabella and Octavian. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>There was<lb/>
                  a constant coming and going between Pri<del>l</del>elau and the rehearsals<lb/>
                  and then the performances of the Salzburg Festival; <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>it was a<lb/>
                  great meeting place for retired birds of paradise such as Lady<lb/>
                  Diana Cooper, <del>X</del> Ledebur and the dancer and choreographer Grete Wiesenthal. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>Gradually, a well-<lb/>
                  worn track developed between Prielau and our house at the upper<lb/>
                  end of the Schmittenhöhe valley, and friendships <del>developed</del>grew between<lb/>
                  my family and the Hofmannsthals and several of their friends<lb/>
                  which have survived and have been continued by our children.<lb/>
                  My marriage broke up during 1957-58 and my son Marko and I went<lb/>
                  to live with my mother-in-law Els<del>e</del>a Musulin at her home Schloss Fridau,<lb/>
                  in Lower Austria, about half an hour's drive from Kirchstetten.<lb/>
                  She will rate<del>s</del> a mention here because of the entertainment value<lb/>
                  she was to acquire for Auden. <space quantity="2" unit="char"/>It was in 1958 that by chance I<lb/>
                  met Christiane Zimmer at Prielau, and she suggested I should call<lb/>
                  on Auden: <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>"After all, he's your neighbour now". <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>I demurred with<lb/>
                  some energy, having a great di<del>l</del>slike of pursuing the famous<lb/>
                  except inthe way of business where an interview i<del>f</del>s called for.<lb/>
                  The next time I saw her - in 1959 - she asked whether I had seen<lb/>
                  Auden, I again scoffed at the very idea that he might "love to<lb/>
                  meet me", and she said "All right. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>I'm just off to spend a<lb/>
                  week there now and I shall fix it <del>up</del> ."<lb/>
                  So in due course I <del>du</del> came to be standing at the green door,<lb/>
                  and yet <del>not a</del>the memory <del>of it</del><unclear>th</unclear>at remains <del>excep</del>is the shock of Chester's<lb/>
                  appearance as he stood in the doorway in the strong sunlight:<lb/>
                  pale, misshapen, fish-e<del>s</del>yed, loose-,<del><unclear>o</unclear></del>mouthed; <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>it was the<lb/>
                  unpromising kind of exterior which makes one impatient to discover<lb/>
                  what lies behind it, the general impression however was one of<lb/>
                  anxious benevolence, and this proved roughly correct.<lb/>

                  - crystallized in "Whitsunday in Kirchstetten" - the local school<lb/>
                  mistress Frau Seitz and her silent husband, and as I came in I ran into<lb/>
                  Auden who was shuffling out to the kitchen.<lb/>
                  <space quantity="5" unit="char"/>"Thank goodness you've come" he hissed, "go and look after<lb/>
                  them, will you, keep the conversation going and hand round the<lb/>
                  cakes." <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>Whereupon he shot into the kitchen for more hot water.<lb/>
                  It was some time before he could abandon the role of the flustered<lb/>
                  host. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>His guests were quite at their ease, and as the years<lb/>
                  went on they became his friends. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>Their composure that day was,<lb/>
                  I am sure, partly due to their own personal qualities, but<lb/>
                  partly too to the fact that in Josef Weinheber they had had<lb/>
                  their local poet laureate before, and now they had one again.<lb/>
                  This was a cause for great satisfaction, but not for any transports<lb/>
                  of ecstasy over the celebrity in their midst.<lb/>
                  <space quantity="5" unit="char"/>What was so "American" about the"kitchen in Lower Austria?"<lb/>
                  Nothing much, so far as I could see. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>When fitted kitchens first<lb/>
                  came in, Austrians <del>called</del>dubbed them "American"<unclear>,</unclear> <del>kitchen<del>.</del>s.</del> <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>The term is<lb/>
                  now as extinct as "Russian" tea, but must still have been<lb/>
                  common parlance in Kirchstetten when Wystan wrote the poem.<lb/>
                  There was a tidy row <del>o</del>consisting of a fridge, sink, low cupboards<lb/>
                  with a good working surface, a corner cupboard the interior of<lb/>
                  which swung out, and a gas stove. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>Both men were very proud of<lb/>
                  the kitchen and it became Chester's habitat. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/><del><gap reason="deleted"/></del>But the whole<lb/>
                  point of a modern kitchen: <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>the clear surfaces, ample storage<lb/>
                  space, accessibility, the careful rationalisation, w<del>q</del>as totally<lb/>
                  cancelled out by the permanent clutter which invaded the <del>kitchen</del>room<lb/>
                  at once and never left it. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>It was a matter of principle with<lb/>
                  Chester to have all cooking ingredients conveniently to hand,<lb/>
                  but this meant that nothing was ever put away, and where his<lb/>
                  loving eye saw method, even the least fussy visitor could only<lb/>
                  observe a shambles. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/><del>A</del>But an interesting shambles,<del> however,</del> because<lb/>
                  of the exotic nature of the preserved foods and spices that<lb/>
                  Chester brought with him. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>From an early date I was convinced<lb/>
                  that the<del>s</del>y were both eating their way into their graves owing to<lb/>
                  the enormous fat content of some of the dishes. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>I remember the<lb/>
                  horror with which I watched a sauce being prepared in the mixer<lb/>
                  before being re-heate<del>e</del>d to accompany the roast duck. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>First Chester<lb/>
                  poured in <del>all</del> the rendered down fat from the baking tin, about half<lb/>
                  a pint of it, then he added an equal quantity of cream, a little<lb/>
                  seasoning, and switched on the mixer. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>The result would have

                  neither Wystan nor Chester walked a yard if they could help it.

                  <space quantity="5" unit="char"/>The small heap of correspondence lying on the filing cabinet<lb/>
                  beside my desk puts me in mind of the rise and fall of the<lb/>
                  telegram as a means of social communication. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>In English novels<lb/>
                  during the period up to and even well beyond the first world war -<lb/>
                  particularly in detective stories - the in<del><gap reason="deleted"/></del>cessant despatch and<lb/>
                  receipt of telegrams, often of some length, play a prominent<lb/>
                  part in human relationships. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>They were an <del>s</del>astonishingly rapid<lb/>
                  and comparatively inexpensive medium of communication and were<lb/>
                  often emplo<del>x</del>yed over short distances. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>In Austria, the reign of<lb/>
                  the telegram persisted into the sixties, lost ground sharply<lb/>
                  owing to automatisation, but enjoyed one last indian summer in<lb/>
                  the <del>P</del>post <del>O</del>office at Kir<del>f</del>chstetten. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>There was no telephone in the<lb/>
                  house at Holzweg 5 because of the distance from the nearest point<lb/>
                  of contact; <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>it would have been too expensive to instal. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>Also,<lb/>
                  Auden liked his peace and quiet and when he wanted to telephone<lb/>
                  he did so from the post office, combining with his daily shopping<lb/>
                  expedition. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>The lack of a telephone accounts for much of my<lb/>
                  correspondence with Auden, or rather, because I have only scant<lb/>
                  records of what I wrote, for his letters to me, and especially<lb/>
                  for the telegrams. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>"We are here, where are you?" or "Wednesday<lb/>
                  would suit perfectly" and so on, are messages which mark the<lb/>
                  development of a cosy routine of coming and going between Schloss<lb/>
                  Fridau, my mother-in-law's place where I have a flat, and<lb/>
                  Kirchstetten. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>"Mama" was an eccentric of the old-fashioned kind<lb/>
                  to be met with in many countries. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>Auden recognised the type at<lb/>
                  once and rejoi<del>f</del>ced: <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>a rough exterior and an abrupt manner, one<lb/>
                  who had feared neither Nazis nor Russian occupiers, obstinate,<lb/>
                  shy, cultured, not troubled by surface blemishes, hospitable,<lb/>
                  terrifyingly outspoken, fond of good food. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/><del>Auden</del>He liked to be<lb/>
                  asked out in any case, and Fridau is an easy 25 minutes drive from<lb/>
                  Kirchstetten, as it were across the fields: <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>not round by<lb/>
                  Böheimkirchen and St.Pölten, but across farmland and through<lb/>
                  villages, <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>along lanes so winding that only a snake could have<lb/>

                  <del>roast</del>wild duck or roast pheasant, with a good wine, followed by<lb/>
                  one of the richer Austrian cakes - Wurmbrand-Torte for i<del>h</del>nstance,<lb/>
                  which consists mainly of ground burnt almonds and creamed chocolate<del>,</del>-<lb/>
                  and then to carry ones wine glass back into the sittingroom and<lb/>
                  wait while the Turkish coffee<del>e</del> ceremony was performed. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>This was,<lb/>
                  d<del>p</del>own all the years that I have known Fridau, and still is, the<lb/>
                  ind<del>k</del>ispen<del>d</del>sable conclusion to lunches even of the humbler, everyday<lb/>
                  sort: <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>turkish coffee with the kaimak hissing faintly as the cup<lb/>
                  is filled - that pale brown foam which must be removed as the coffee<lb/>
                  <del>comes</del>rises to the boil and carefully shared out between the empty cups.<lb/>
                  Failure to do this is the unforgiveable sin. <space quantity="2" unit="char"/>And Auden would sit,<lb/>
                  <del>filled with </del> well nourished, blinking in the sunshine from the<lb/>
                  window opposite him from where he could see the crown of an immense<lb/>
                  pear tree. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>After his second cup he was likel<del>s</del>y to leap to his feet<lb/>
                  without any of those preliminary movements of eyes, hands and feet<lb/>
                  with which people signal their imm<del>e</del>inent departure, shake hands<lb/>
                  all round and hurry away. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>But sometimes <del>there </del> he felt like a turn<lb/>
                  round the park, or even to stay on for a time, sitting in a deck<lb/>
                  chair under the trees in the courtyard. <space quantity="2" unit="char"/>But if he hurried, it was<lb/>
                  no discourtesy; <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>Wystan was the most courteous of men, w<del>g</del>ho liked<lb/>
                  to follow the customs of <del>a</del> the country he lived in, and above all<lb/>
                  he had no special voice for <del>inferiors</del>employees.. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>He got on well with<lb/>
                  Austrian people who sometimes - without the natural excuse of<lb/>
                  his food storekeeper in St. Mark's Place - had no idea of the calibre of<lb/>
                  the man with whom, in his home or theirs, they were having a meal.<lb/>
                  As I knew him, the only thing he couldn't bear was pretension.<lb/>
                  <space quantity="5" unit="char"/>So one would have supposed that writers young and older<lb/>
                  would have lost no time in beating a path out to Kirchstetten.<lb/>
                  Are writers convivial creatures? <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>Do they like to congregate<lb/>
                  together for mutual admiration and to complain about their<lb/>
                  publishers? <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>At some times and in some places, yes, at others no;<lb/>
                  that they have the patience to listen to each other reading their<lb/>
                  works aloud is true, probably, only <del>under seg</del>in circumstances of<lb/>
                  political persecution. <space quantity="2" unit="char"/>Be it as it may, I sometimes see Auden's<lb/>
                  relationship with the literary scene in Austria - such as it is -<lb/>

                  filmed, and the Gesellschaft für Literatur did it<del>x</del>s duty by him<lb/>
                  and more, from start to finish. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/><unclear>I</unclear>t still does. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>But the Austrian<lb/>
                  Soci<del>a</del>ety for Literature is nei<del>gh</del>ther a club nor a coffee house<lb/>
                  but a society for the promotion of literature with a particular<lb/>
                  mission to writers in communist eastern Europe. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>Somehow, in the<lb/>
                  sixties, there was otherwise no group of people, no meeting place<lb/>
                  towards which Auden himself could naturally gravitate. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>Think of<lb/>
                  this in terms of the old pre-war Vienna, the life in the coffee<lb/>
                  houses where the literary figures of the earlier 20th century<lb/>
                  congregated, where they spent their days, read their correspondence<lb/>
                  and the newspapers, read and wrote criticisms, blacked each<lb/>
                  other's characters: <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>the Café Central and the Herrenhof. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>I can<lb/>
                  imagine Auden in this atmosphere very well, e<del>j</del>njoying the<lb/>
                  opportunity it gave him of rubbing shoulders with writers of all<lb/>
                  ages, and particularly with the young, as it were by chance,<lb/>
                  without further commitment on either side and with the minimum<lb/>
                  of effort. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>I can see the cigarette ash on the marble topped<lb/>
                  tables, the mounds of paper, see Auden slopping to and fro in<lb/>
                  <del>hsi</del> his eternal bedroom slippers between his table and the<lb/>
                  telephone kiosk. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>But this world ended when Egon Friedell,<lb/>
                  giving the passers by a shou<del>o</del>t of warning as he did so, jumped<lb/>
                  out of the window to his death on the entry of the Nazis. <space quantity="2" unit="char"/>It<lb/>
                  was a world, described again and again by those who knew it,<lb/>
                  never more effectively than by one of its last active, working<lb/>
                  survivors, Friedrich Torberg, and it has gone for ever. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>Today's<lb/>
                  writer<del>y</del>s have no time. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>They are dashing from recording studios<lb/>
                  be<del>s</del>yond Schönbrunn to newspaper offices at the opposite end of<lb/>
                  Vienna, from the head post office to their homes, where they kiss<lb/>
                  wife and children, snatch a bag and rush to the airport or to<lb/>
                  a railway terminal.<lb/>
                  <space quantity="5" unit="char"/>Alternatively, like Thomas Bernhard, they bury themselves<lb/>
                  in a farmhouse in a district carefully chosen for its unfashion-<lb/>
                  ableness and difficulty of access, emerging, like cats, only on<lb/>
                  their own terms, preferring to turn up unannounced in their<lb/>
                  friends' houses, perhaps late at night, enquiring for just that<lb/>
                  ration of warmth, light and unquestioning <del>q</del>acceptance which,<lb/>
                  at that moment, they happen<del>ed</del> to need. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>Bernhard's fame has now<lb/>
                  altered the character of the district he lives in and he has<lb/>

                  <space quantity="5" unit="char"/>Unless Auden had friends to stay, talk of this quality was<lb/>
                  a rare occurrence. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>It was possible to see why Bernhard, to take<lb/>

                  early years in Kirchstetten Auden did feel slighted by some of<lb/>
                  his translators in Austria and Germany who would publish their<lb/>
                  work in literary magazines, and if the poet himself ever heard<lb/>
                  of it, it was by pure chance. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>"They don't" he said indignantly,<lb/>
                  "even send me a copy of their paper". <space quantity="2" unit="char"/>Nor, in those days, was<lb/>
                  he satisfied with the quality of the work. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>He said to an<lb/>
                  interviewer in Berlin§, at a time when little of his poetry<lb/>
                  had been translated into German: <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>"Translating poetry into a<lb/>
                  different language is very very problematical - and apart from<lb/>

                  image a word or a phrase was intended to call up in the reader.<lb/>
                  "For instance, I spoke in a poem about corn - maize - but the<lb/>

                  <space quantity="4" unit="char"/>The fifty minute drive to Kirchstetten presented too great<lb/>
                  a psychological barrier even to the young, now dead, author and<lb/>
                  poet Gerhard Fritsch (he committed suicide) who translated Auden's<lb/>
                  Christmas Oratorio "For the Time Being" into German. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>It was<lb/>
                  published in 1961 under the <del>tiel</del> title "Hier und Jetzt" (here and<lb/>

                  demonstrate a style of writing which has always been very English<lb/>
                  and is characteristic of Auden even within the confines of a<lb/>
                  stanza: <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>shifts in tone from the lofty to the colloquial. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>In<lb/>

                  exercise was one with which Auden wholly agreed: <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>to encourage<lb/>

                  the last decades of the nineteenth century and lasted until the<lb/>

                  that he, like the composer Bruckner, 'has not travelled well'.<lb/>

                  <space quantity="5" unit="char"/>Auden immensely enjoyed working on Goethe's "Italian<lb/>

                  the original caused by Goethe's own faulty editing. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>Goethe as<lb/>
                  a man fascinated him - three items in "Forewords and Afterwords"<lb/>
                  and much else of an earlier date are there to prove it. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>So it<lb/>
                  can't have been later than 1962 when there was a ring at the<lb/>
                  doorbell of my flat in Vienna. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>I opene<del>e</del>d the door and there was<lb/>
                  Auden, panting, as well he might because this was before our<lb/>
                  lift was put in and he had climbed nin<del>t</del>ety steps from street<lb/>
                  level. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>His shirt was grubby, his tie askew, his hair was<lb/>
                  matted, and before he was half through the door and with no<lb/>
                  further greeting he gasped out:<lb/>
                  <space quantity="4" unit="char"/>"I have come to the concl<del>i</del>usion that Goethe was a very<lb/>

                  the truth of this is to be found in the best known poems of his<lb/>

                  an element in this sense of identity might have been this:<lb/>

                  had made a political error and had entirely turned away from it.<lb/>
                  Weinheber had allowed himself to be wooed by the Nazis, but<lb/>
                  later on he rejected it all and finally he committed suicide.<lb/>
                  This may be fanciful; <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>it is put forward simply as a suggestion.<lb/>
                  Auden knew that he would have got on with the man next door.

                  A number of journalists and a few public figures were present<lb/>

                  we only had to wait for the knockout blow from Mar<del>f</del>cel Reich-Ranicki.<lb/>
                  On the whole it was this leading West German critic with his<lb/>

                  <space quantity="5" unit="char"/>Since I have no pretensions to being a literary hostess,<lb/>
                  I found the pro<del>p</del>spect alarming. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>It was not that, as a journalist,<lb/>
                  famous men worried me in the least, but famous women are somehow<lb/>
                  a different matter and I was inclined to be overawed by Mary<lb/>
                  MacCarthy. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>But Chester was reassuring. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>"Don't you worry about<lb/>
                  Mary, she won't eat you. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>In fact<del>thse</del> she'll be charming, she'll<lb/>

                  the very least, she should arrive with them. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>I did neither.<lb/>
                  Having allowed myself to be pushed down to towards the front<lb/>
                  of the hall, I was trapped and unable to get out, whereas the<lb/>
                  members of the congress left the platform and were free. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/><del>H</del> I<lb/>
                  at last fought my way out and the search began for Yefrim <del>Yek</del>Etkind<lb/>
                  whom I had invited as an eastern foil for the westerners<del>!</del> <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>He<lb/>
                  was run to ground in a back passage, surrounded by fans. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>It was<lb/>
                  only with the help of the Vienn<del>s</del>a<del>se</del> <del>F</del>fire <del>B</del>brigade who were clearing<lb/>
                  the bui<del>o</del>lding that I was at last able to extract him from the<lb/>
                  admiring group and take him out to my car. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>Knowing that the<lb/>
                  rest of the party would be standing outside a locked door<del>k</del>, I<lb/>
                  drove fast. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>Etkind settled himself comfortably, stretched out<lb/>
                  his legs for a better purchase and said affably: <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>"<del>Y</del>One day you<lb/>
                  must come to Leningrad, you'd love to drive there - large, wide,<lb/>
                  empty streets." <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>Since then I have dreamed, Toad-like, of tearing<lb/>
                  down the almost deserted Nevsky Prospect, but in the meantime<lb/>
                  Etkind, about whom Auden worried greatly as time went on, mainly<lb/>
                  on account of his friendship with Sacharow, has left Russia<lb/>
                  and is living and working in France. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>And so there the<del>s</del>y all were, a<lb/>
                  not too friendly row of faces gazing over the banisters <del>into the </del><lb/>
                  on the second floor as we puffed our way upstairs: <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>Auden,<lb/>
                  Kallman, Mary MacCarthy, the Toynbees, the author and critic<lb/>
                  Hilde Spiel and a Danish journalist friend. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>But over drink and<lb/>
                  food the party soon cheered up, and Mary sighed: <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>"What heaven<lb/>
                  it is to get away from that man Reich-Ranicki!" <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>There was a<lb/>

                  to deliver the opening address - a highly festive occasion, and<lb/>
                  his spee<del>d</del>ch would be widely reported. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>By late April he had already<lb/>
                  made a draft, and he asked me for my comments. <space quantity="2" unit="char"/>He had, he said,<lb/>
                  built in a good deal of criticism, but could he get away with it?<lb/>
                  Was the package sufficiently decorative? <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>After a quick read<lb/>
                  through I looked up and caught Auden's enquiring eye. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>What on<lb/>
                  earth could I say? <space quantity="2" unit="char"/>No amount of packaging could disguise the<lb/>
                  fact that this was <del>an</del>a full frontal attack on the policy behind the Salzburg<lb/>
                  Festival and its administration; <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>it appeared to be wholly negative<lb/>
                  and <del>(</del>the estimated length of half an hour was probably too long.<lb/>
                  Towards the end, where he should be riding high in an appeal for<lb/>
                  devotion to <del>the</del> optimal standards in music and the arts in general<lb/>
                  and opera in particular, he was grumbling about the <del>functional</del><lb/>
                  erratic workings of the curtain in the Festspielhaus and the lack<lb/>
                  of canteen facilities for the scen<del>s</del>eshifters. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>It was a horrible<lb/>
                  anticlimax. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/><del>It was not easy to say</del>How could one tell him this in such a way as to<lb/>
                  get results without offending him? <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>And there was another thing:<lb/>
                  he should be advised to rehearse. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>Auden understood all the nuances<lb/>
                  of the German language, but his spoken German was not as good as<lb/>
                  he seemed to think, <del>being</del> and his delivery was apt to become<lb/>
                  almost incomprehensible.

                  domestic disaster and a request for help, and the winter of 1967<lb/>
                  brought serious disruption to the peaceful running of the house<lb/>
                  at Kirchstetten. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>Auden's poem to Emma Eiermann begins in German:<lb/>
                  <l>Liebe Frau Emma,</l> / <l>na, was hast du denn gemacht?</l><lb/>
                  and it contains just about all there is to say about her, and her<lb/>

                  <space quantity="5" unit="char"/>In February 1968 he flew over to Vienna to interview <del>a co</del><lb/>
                  Frau Strobl after the death of Emma Eiermann. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>We were lunching<lb/>
                  together at the Opern-Café and this was one of the very few<lb/>
                  occasions when I kept a note of what had been said. <space quantity="2" unit="char"/>Auden had<lb/>
                  fr<del>3</del>equently taken a stand against drug-taking, and had made his<lb/>
                  attitude clear in a number of lectures and interviews. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>In<lb/>
                  October 1967, for instance, he brought up the subject in a lecture<lb/>
                  at Eliot College, and now I told him I was glad he had been<lb/>
                  saying to young people in England that LSD is a dead duc<del><unclear>h</unclear></del>k for<lb/>
                  creative workers. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>This led to a long account of the experiments<lb/>
                  with LSD and <del>M</del>mescalin that he himself had carried out in the<lb/>
                  company of his doctor. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>He was perfe<del>f</del>ctly certain that no original<lb/>
                  line of poetry and no work of art had ever been created under the<lb/>
                  influence of drugs, and he was convinced that Aldou<del>x</del>s Huxley did<lb/>
                  a lot of harm by publishing his experiences with mescalin, and<lb/>

                  This was Auden's favourite story. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>She caught him once when<lb/>
                  he had nipped round to the garage in Fridau to a look at the<lb/>

                  may have been the time she left the road and charged through<lb/>
                  one of those telegraph poles with two legs in the shape of<lb/>
                  an inverted Y, or another time when she failed to take a<lb/>
                  bend in the road and ended up with one wheel suspended<lb/>

                  all events there was a long and painful silence - Mama was<lb/>
                  famous for her silences - which Auden found it difficult to<lb/>
                  br<del>d</del>eak. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>Whenever I saw him again for the first time after<lb/>
                  his arrival in the spring, sooner or later a look of gleeful<lb/>

                  <space quantity="5" unit="char"/>The reason why Auden himself failed one day to take a<lb/>
                  corner in Kirchstetten village and crashed I never had the<lb/>
                  courage to ask. <space quantity="3" unit="char"/>It happened on the first day of his<lb/>

                  he had had an <del>c</del>accident, was in St. Pölten hospital and could I<lb/>
                  come at my convenience? <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>As my informant thought that Auden<lb/>
                  was about to be sent home it seemed advisable to telephone<lb/>
                  the hospital and find out where he would be by the afternoon.<lb/>
                  The following conversation ensued:<lb/>
                  <space quantity="4" unit="char"/>"May I ask whether Professor Auden is still in hospital ,<lb/>
                  presumably in the <del>accident</del> casualty department, or whether he<lb/>

                  grie<del>d</del>f that he, Auden, had hardly been able to understand him on<lb/>

                  A protracted search produced no signs that he had been in Austria<lb/>
                  at all, and it finally turned out that he had never left Athens.<lb/>
                  Letters flew to and fro on the subjects of: <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>release of corpse,<lb/>

                  <space quantity="4" unit="char"/>When Auden and Kallman got back to Austria in <del>the</del> April<lb/>
                  Chester was still profoundly shaken up and I remember Auden's<lb/>
                  anxiety, saying to me "I don't know how he's going to get<lb/>

                  these two writers: <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>the lesser poet but much younger man,<lb/>
                  cooking too much rich food for the entirely sedentary life<lb/>
                  that they both led, but otherwise with little purpose left.<del>in</del><lb/>
                  And the far greater and much older poet, with his regular<lb/>
                  hours of work and his considerable <del>p</del>output. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>The days of their<lb/>
                  very fruitful collaboration on opera libretti were already<lb/>
                  over; <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>what remained was the Times crossword.<lb/>
                  <space quantity="5" unit="char"/>It was so easy, I think, to make fun of the slightly<lb/>

                  Auden was a very hard-working, systematic, self-disciplined<lb/>
                  writer<del>s</del>, who knew, none better, how nice it is to sit sipping<lb/>
                  a cool drink in the shade of a tree, whiling away the hour<del>w</del>s,<lb/>
                  looking with contentment upon his flowers and his asparagus beds.<lb/>
                  This he <del>dd<del>ie</del></del> did, but having worked steadily through from 9 o'clock<lb/>
                  until lunchtime. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>And much of the bosky content<del>n</del>ment, the cool<lb/>
                  drinks and so on, were si<del>j</del>mply owing to the presence of guests,<lb/>
                  including the journalist with his sharp eye. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>So that these<lb/>
                  sometimes rather rib-nudging descriptions of this unconventional<lb/>
                  household leave it altogether to us to remember that in the<lb/>
                  last dozen years of his life, Auden was writing several volumes<lb/>
                  of poetry, opera libretti, translating the Elder Ed<del>e</del>da, the<lb/>
                  "Italian Journey ", Dag Hammarskjöld's "Markings" and other<lb/>
                  works, editing "The Dyer's Hand", the "Faber Book of Aphorisms",<lb/>
                  his Commonplace Book, "Forewords and Afterwords", and that<lb/>
                  heavenly compilation the "Nineteenth Century Book of Minor Poets".<lb/>
                  He was reading over an enormous field, writing and delivering<lb/>
                  le<del>x</del>ctures, writing articles and book reviews - sometimes they<lb/>

                  <space quantity="5" unit="char"/>Between the ages of six and twelve, <del>P</del>I spent a great many<lb/>

                  which they performed with unfailing patience and generosity.<lb/>
                  <space quantity="5" unit="char"/>From this activity, I learned certain principles which I was<lb/>
                  later to find applied to all artistic fabrication. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>First, whatever<lb/>
                  other elements it may include, the initial impulse to create a<lb/>
                  secondary world is a feeling of awe aroused by encounters, in the<lb/>
                  Primary World, with sacred beings or events. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>This feeling of awe<lb/>
                  is an imperative, that is to say, one is not free to choose the<lb/>
                  object or the event that arouses it. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>Though every work of art<lb/>
                  is a secondary world, it cannot be constructed <hi rend="underline">ex nihilo</hi>, but is<lb/>
                  a selection from and a recombination of the contents of the<lb/>
                  Primary World. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>Even the '<del>ö</del>purest' poem, in the French Symboliste<lb/>
                  sense, is made of words which are not <del>e</del>the poet's private property,<lb/>
                  but the communal creation of the linguistic group to whom he<lb/>
                  belongs, so that their meaning can be looked up in a dictionary.<lb/>
                  <space quantity="5" unit="char"/>Secondly, in constructing my private world, I discovered<lb/>
                  that, though this was a game, or rather precisely <hi rend="underline">because it was a</hi><lb/>
                  game - that is to say, not a necessity like eating or sleeping,<lb/>
                  but something I was free to do or not as a chose - it could not<lb/>
                  be played without rules. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>Absolute freedom is meaningless:<lb/>
                  freedom can only be realised in a choice between alternatives.<lb/>
                  A secondary world, be it a poem, or a game of football or bridge,<lb/>
                  must be as much a world of law as the Primary, the only difference<lb/>
                  being that in the world of games one is free to decide what its<lb/>
                  laws shall be. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>But to all games as to real life, Goethe's lines<lb/>
                  apply.

                  choosing what objects were to be included, I was free to select<lb/>

                  water-turb<del>u</del>ine, which could be found in a text-book on mining<lb/>
                  machinery or a manufacturer's catalogue: <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>but I was not free to<lb/>
                  invent one. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>In deciding how my world was to function, I could<lb/>

                  magic means were forbidden. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>When I say forbidden, I mean that I<lb/>
                  felt, in some obscure way, that they were morally forbidden.<lb/>
                  Then there came a day when the moral issue became quite conscious.<lb/>
                  As I was planning my Platonic <del>i</del>Idea of a concentrating-mill, I<lb/>
                  ran into difficulties. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>I had to choose between two types of a<lb/>
                  certain mach<del>u</del>ine for separating the slimes, called a buddle.<lb/>
                  One type I found more sacred or 'beautiful', but the other type<lb/>
                  was, I knew from my reading, the more efficient. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>At this point<lb/>
                  I realised that it was my moral duty to sacrifice my aesthetic<lb/>
                  preference to reality or truth.<lb/>
                  <space quantity="5" unit="char"/>When, later, I began to write poetry, I found that, for me<lb/>
                  at least, the same obligation was binding. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>That is to say, I<lb/>
                  cannot accept the doctrine that, in poetry, there is a 'suspension<lb/>
                  of belief'. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>A poet must never make a statement simply because<lb/>
                  it sounds poetically exciting: <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>he must also believe it to be true.<lb/>
                  This does not mean, of course, that one can only appreciate a<lb/>
                  poet whose beliefs happen to co-incide with one's own. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>It does<lb/>
                  mean, however, that one must be convinced that the poet really<lb/>
                  believes what he says, however odd the belief may seem to oneself.<lb/>
                  <space quantity="4" unit="char"/>Between constructing a private fantasy world for oneself alone<lb/>
                  and writing poetry, there is, of course, a profound difference.<lb/>
                  A fantasy world exists only in the head of its creator: <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>a poem<lb/>
                  is a public verbal object intended to be read and enjoyed by others.<lb/>
                  To become conscious of others is to become conscious of historical<lb/>
                  time.in various ways. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>The contents of a poem are necessarily<lb/>
                  past experiences, and the goal of a poem is necessarily in the<lb/>
                  future, since it cannot be read until it has been <del>wirt</del> written.<lb/>
                  Again, to write a poem is to engage in an activity which human<lb/>
                  beings have practised for centuries. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>If one asks why human beings<lb/>
                  make poems or paint pictures or compose music, I can see two<lb/>
                  possible answers. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>Firstly all the artistic media are forms of<lb/>
                  an activity peculiar to human beings, namely, Personal Speech.<lb/>
                  Many animals have impersonal codes of communications, visual,<lb/>
                  olfactory, auditory signals, <del>n</del>by which they conve<del>s</del>y to other members

                  is sometimes quite erroneously called 'self-expression'. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>If I<lb/>

                  any artist has to convey is a perception of a reality common to<lb/>
                  all, but seen from a unique perspective, which it is his duty as<lb/>
                  well as his pleasure to share with others. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>To small truths as<lb/>

                  an art-historian to date a work, at least, approximately. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>If,<lb/>
                  for example, one listens to a composition by Palestrina and one by<lb/>
                  Mozart, one knows immediately that, quit<del>d</del>e aside from their artistic<lb/>
                  merits, Palestrina must have live<del>e</del>d earlier than Mozart: <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>he could<lb/>
                  not possibly have written as he did after Mozart. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>By Permanence,<lb/>
                  I mean that<del>h</del> the work continues to have relevance<del>,</del> and importance<lb/>
                  long after its creator is dead. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>In the history of Art, unlike the<lb/>

               <p>
                  works of art, on the other hand, are of the utmost importance<lb/>
                  to the contemporary practitioner. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>Every artist tries to produce<lb/>
                  something now, but in the hope that, in time, it will take its<lb/>
                  proper place in the tradition of his art. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>And he cannot pro<del>u</del>duce<lb/>
                  anything significantly original unless he knows well what has <del>be</del><lb/>
                  already been done; <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>that is to say, he cannot 'rebel' against the<lb/>
                  past without having a profound reverence for it.<lb/>
                  <space quantity="4" unit="char"/>There are periods in history when the arts develop uninterr-<lb/>
                  uptedly, each generation building on the achievements of the<lb/>
                  previous generation. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>There are other periods when radical breaks<lb/>
                  seem to be ne<del>f</del>cessary. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>However, when they are, one will generally<lb/>
                  find that the 'radical' artist does not disown the past, but finds<lb/>
                  in works of a much earlier period or in those of a cul<del>r</del>ture (other)<lb/>
                  than his own, the clue as to what he should do now. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>In my own<lb/>
                  case, for example, I know how much I owe to Anglo-Saxon and<lb/>
                  Medieval Poetry.<lb/>
                  <space quantity="5" unit="char"/>When I review the contemporary artistic scene, it strikes me<lb/>
                  how extraordinarily fortunate men like Stravinsky, Picasso, Eliot,<lb/>
                  etc., that is, those persons we think of as the founders of<lb/>
                  'modern' art, were in being born when they were, so that they came<lb/>
                  to manhoo<del>f</del><unclear>d</unclear> before 1914. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>Until the First World War, western<lb/>
                  society was still pretty much what it had been in the nineteenth<lb/>
                  century. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>This meant that for these artists, the felt need to<lb/>
                  create something new arose from an artistic imperative, not a<lb/>
                  historic imperative. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>No one asked himself: <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>"What is the proper<lb/>
                  kind of music to compose or picture to paint or poem to w<del>ir</del>rite<lb/>
                  in the year 1912?" <space quantity="2" unit="char"/>Secondly, their contemporary audiences<lb/>
                  were mostly conservative, but honestly so. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>Those, for instance,<lb/>

               <p>
                  <space quantity="5" unit="char"/>In times, like our own, of rapid social change and political<lb/>
                  crisis, there is always a danger of confusing the principles<lb/>
                  governing political action and those governing artistic fabrication<unclear>.</unclear><lb/>
                  The most important of such confusions are three.<lb/>
                  <space quantity="4" unit="char"/>Firstly, one may come to think of artistic fabrication as a<lb/>
                  form of political action. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>Every citizen, poets included, has a<lb/>
                  duty to be politically 'engagé', that is, to play a responsible<lb/>
                  part i<del>s</del>n seeing that the society of which he is a member shall<lb/>
                  fun<del>a</del>ction properly and improve. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>But the poet, qua poet, has only<lb/>
                  one political function. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>Since language is his medium, it is his<lb/>
                  duty, by hi<del>w</del>s own example, to defend his mother-tongue against<lb/>
                  corruption by demagogues, journalists, the mass-media etc. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>As<lb/>
                  Karl Kraus said: <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>"<del><gap reason="deleted"/></del><hi rend="underline"><unclear><del>E</del>D</unclear>Die Sprache ist die Mutter, nicht das Magd</hi>,<lb/>
                  des Gedankens<del>.</del>", and when language loses its meaning, <del>social </del><lb/>
                  its place is taken by violence. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>Of course, the poet may use<lb/>
                  political and social events as subject-matter for poems - they<lb/>
                  are as much a part of human experience as love or nature - bu<del>z</del>t<lb/>
                  he must never imagine that his poems have the power to affect<lb/>
                  the course of history. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>The poli<del>c</del>tical and social history of<lb/>
                  Europe would be w<del>z</del>hat it has been if Dante, Shakespeare, Goethe,<lb/>
                  Michael Angelo, Titian, Mozart, Beethoven, etc. had never e<del>d</del>xisted.<lb/>
                  <space quantity="5" unit="char"/>Where political and social evils are concerned, only two<lb/>
                  things are effective: <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>political action and straightforward,<lb/>
                  truthful, detailed journalistic rapportage of the facts. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>The Arts<lb/>
                  are powerless.<lb/>
                  <space quantity="4" unit="char"/>The second confusion, of which Plato is the most famous examp<del>o</del>le,<lb/>
                  is to take artistic fabrication as the model f<del>r</del>or a good society.

               <p>
                  Such a model, if put into practice, is bound to produce a tyranny.<lb/>
                  The aim of the artist is to produce an object which is complete<lb/>
                  and will endure without change. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>In the 'city' of a poem, there<lb/>
                  are always the same inhabitants doing exactly the same jobs for<lb/>
                  ever. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>A societ<del>s</del>y which was really like a good poem, embodying the<lb/>
                  aesthetic virtues of order, economy and subordination of the<lb/>
                  detail to the whole, would be a nightmare of horror for, given the<lb/>
                  historical reality of actual men, such a society could only come<lb/>
                  into being through selective breeding, extermination of the<lb/>
                  physically and mentally unfit, absolute obedience to its Director,<lb/>
                  a large slave class kept out of sight in cellars and the strictest<lb/>
                  censureship (sic) of the Arts, forbidding anything to be said<lb/>
                  which is out of keeping with the official 'line'.<lb/>
                  <space quantity="4" unit="char"/>The third confusion, typical of our western 'free' so<del>f</del>cieties<lb/>
                  at this time, is the opposite of Plato's, namely to take political<lb/>
                  action as the model for artistic fabrication. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>Political action<lb/>
                  is a necessity, that is to say, at (e)very moment something has<lb/>
                  to be done, and it is momentary - action at this moment is<lb/>
                  immediately followed by another action at the next. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>Artistic<lb/>
                  fabrication, on the other hand, is voluntary - the alternative<lb/>
                  to one work of art can be no work of art - and the artistic<lb/>
                  object is permanent, that is to say, immune to historical change.<lb/>
                  The attempt to model artistic fabrication on political action can<lb/>
                  therefore, only r<del>d</del>educe it to momenta<del>f</del>ry and arbitrary 'happenings',<lb/>
                  a conformism with the tyranny of the immediate moment which is<lb/>
                  far more enslaving and destructive of integrity than any conformism<lb/>
                  with past tradition.<lb/>
                  <space quantity="4" unit="char"/>At this point, a little digression on the subject of 'free'<lb/>
                  verse, which seems now to be almost universal among young poets.<lb/>
                  Though excellent examples, the poems of D.H<del>-</del>. Lawrence, for example,<lb/>
                  exist, they are, in my opinion, the exception, not the rule.<lb/>
                  The great virtue of formal metrical rules is that they forbid<lb/>
                  automatic responses and, by forcing the poet to have second<lb/>
                  thoughts, free him from the fetters of self. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>All too often, the<lb/>
                  result of not having a fixed form to be true to, is a self-<lb/>
                  indulgence which in the detached reader can only cause boredom.<lb/>
                  Further, in my experience, contrary to what one might expect, the<lb/>
                  free-verse poets sound much mor<del>d</del>e like each other than those who<lb/>
                  write in fixed forms. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>Whatever freedom may do, it does not, it<lb/>
                  would seem, <del>a<unclear>m</unclear></del> make for originality.

                  <space quantity="5" unit="char"/>What, then, can the Arts do for us? <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>In my opinion, they can<lb/>

                  I think, have been because of an innate lack of intelligence<lb/>

                  is I think in the exact sense of the word sacram<del>a</del>ental. Holding<lb/>
                  the insights that he di<del>e</del>d into the nature of the poet's struggle<lb/>
                  with the primary world, it is hardly surprising that he should<lb/>

               <p>
                  Afterwards, I had given a lift home to a carload of people<lb/>
                  including one whose pockets, had <del>I</del><unclear>I</unclear> but known it, were stuffed<lb/>
                  with Chester's money - lifted from a jacket h<del>u</del>anging on the<lb/>
                  bedroom door. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>The party itself had been all but wrecked by a<lb/>
                  loudly argumentative individual who succeeded in clearing the<lb/>
                  sittingroom altogether as the gue<del>e</del>sts gradually slunk off to the<lb/>
                  kitchen, refugees from his abrasive but tedious presen<del>f</del>ce.<lb/>
                  Auden's reply was:<lb/>
                  <space quantity="4" unit="char"/>"So! <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>You encountered the one-whose-name-we-never-mention.<lb/>
                  Why Chester should have been so foolish as to invite him to a<lb/>
                  party I cannot imagine. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>If he is to be seen at all he is to<lb/>

                  <space quantity="5" unit="char"/>My next sighting of this cloven-hooved adjunct to the<lb/>
                  Viennese literary scene was at Auden's funeral, where I watched<lb/>
                  him work his way up the procession to the church until he found<lb/>
                  the place he sought: <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>immediately behind the coffin among the<lb/>
                  chief mourners. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>Wondering at this, and remembering Wystan's<lb/>
                  sinister euphemism, <del><unclear>I</unclear></del>I subsequently asked Chester whether Auden<lb/>
                  had ever liked the man. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>"LIKED him?" shrieked Chester. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>"Why,<lb/>
                  he crossed himself whenever his name was mentioned."<lb/>
                  <space quantity="5" unit="char"/>In that same letter to Ne<del>e</del>w Work I mentioned that a friend<lb/>
                  of his had quoted him as using the term - as a definition of<lb/>
                  humour - "Serious insistence on unseriousness." <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>His response<lb/>
                  was as follows: <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>"X has a genius for subtle misrepresentation.<lb/>
                  'Serious insistence on unseriousness' telescopes two distinct<lb/>
                  <del>d</del>convictions of mine, falsifying both.<lb/>
                  One. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>I believe it to be a serious moral error when an artist<lb/>
                  overestimates the importance of art and, by implication, of<lb/>
                  himself. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>One must admit that the political history of Europe,<lb/>

                  Two. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>I believe that the only way in which, to-day at any rate,<lb/>
                  one can speak <hi rend="underline">seriously</hi> about serious matters (the alternative<lb/>

                  any other people, surely, they have seen in serious matters,<lb/>
                  that is to say, human suffering, the contradictions of human<lb/>

                  brief domestic chronicle he adds that a friend of his who teaches<lb/>
                  schyzophrenics had a seventeen year old girl who was interested<lb/>
                  in poetry. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>Asked what poets she liked, she mentioned Auden.<lb/>
                  <del>'</del>'I happen to know him quite well'said the friend. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>To wh<del>8</del>ich the<lb/>

                  (Auden was about 58 at the time).<lb/>
                  <space quantity="5" unit="char"/>That deeply scored face which struck awe into so many people<lb/>
                  who saw him, that battlefield so mercilessly displayed above dozens<lb/>
                  upon dozens of newspaper articles: <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>when I look at my own photographs<lb/>
                  of him I am appalled at the speed of the development. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>It was a<lb/>
                  head straight out of the icelandic sagas, or a prehistoric head<lb/>
                  from the bogs of Jutland. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>Auden should have been car<del>c</del>ved, much<lb/>
                  larger than life, by Henry Moore and placed in effigy on a high hill.<lb/>
                  <space quantity="5" unit="char"/>Abruptly, the way most statements emerged from Auden, he said<lb/>
                  one day at lunch: <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>"Kokoschka wants to paint me." <space quantity="1" unit="char"/><unclear>I</unclear>t appears that<lb/>
                  Oskar Kokoschka had written and asked him to come to Switzerland.<lb/>
                  But Auden felt it was too much of an effort, and evidently the much<lb/>
                  older man felt the same way, so that nothing came of it. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/><unclear>I</unclear>t is a<lb/>
                  great pity, because for one thing they would have enjoyed each<lb/>
                  other's company, and the sight of these physically so oddly similar<lb/>
                  men sitting together must have fired some onlooker if only to the<lb/>
                  extent of taking a historic snapshot. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>Nor does Auden's closing<lb/>
                  remark on the subject provide much compensation for the lack of the<lb/>
                  portrait, though the thought satisfied him. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>"After all", he said,<lb/>
                  as he reached for his wine glass and narrowed his eyes to slits<lb/>
                  against the su<del>b</del>nlight seeping in from the garden, "After all, I AM<lb/>
                  a Kokoschka painting."<lb/>
                  <space quantity="4" unit="char"/>But the causes: <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>the question needs to be answered. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/><hi rend="underline">Why</hi> was<lb/>
                  Auden, in his sixties and indeed much earlier, a prematurely aged<lb/>
                  man? <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>"Ein alter Mann", one or two German obituarists were to write,<lb/>
                  but without surprise, or: <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>"the aged poet" - when he was 68!<lb/>
                  <space quantity="4" unit="char"/>Surely not. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>There is one e<del>d</del>xplanation which I place on record<lb/>
                  only after much hesitation. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>Some time after Auden's death Chester<lb/>
                  Kallman gave me his e<del>d</del>xplanation for the evidence that Wystan had<lb/>
                  become older than his years warranted: <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>he put the phenomenon down<lb/>
                  to Benzedrine. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>"For how long?" <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>Oh, said Chester, he began right<lb/>
                  back in his early years in the States. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>And he had carried on right<lb/>

                  in Austria. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>Most people now have forgotten about Benzedrene;<lb/>
                  other things <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>have taken its place. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>Chester reminded me that it<lb/>
                  was the stimulant with the help of which airmen in wartime,<lb/>
                  examinees, doctors and so on, could keep themselves going in a<lb/>
                  state of complete wakefulness, to carry them through a period<lb/>
                  of temporary stress. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>Taken for a restricted purpose, perhaps by<lb/>
                  a surgeon faced with operations round the clock after a major<lb/>
                  disaster, it was a blessing. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>Physical reserves would be replaced<lb/>
                  later when the emergency was over. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>But to take Benzedr<del>e</del>ine over a<lb/>
                  long period meant - I am quoting Kallman and subject to correction -<lb/>
                  using up ones body at an accelerated rate with the obvious<lb/>
                  consequence that it would become prematurely aged.<lb/>
                  <space quantity="4" unit="char"/>It would be difficult to think of any reason why Chester should<lb/>
                  say <del>r</del>this if it were not substantially true. <space quantity="2" unit="char"/>As to why Auden<lb/>
                  should have felt he needed such a powerful stimulant, over and<lb/>
                  above those which modern man indulges in as a matter of course -<lb/>
                  coffee, tea, alcohol and cigaret<del>e</del>tes - his friends of those <del>days</del><lb/>
                  years can answer. <space quantity="2" unit="char"/>Perhaps an extract from Edmund Wilson's<lb/>
                  "W.H. Auden in America" is helpful: <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>it is one of a collection of<lb/>
                  critical essays edited by Monroe Spears and published in 1964:<lb/>

                  of 1968 Vienna was filled with people who had come across the<lb/>

                  Austrian whose identity was never fully revealed, though<lb/>
                  Chester muttered to me: <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>"W<del>Y</del>ystan is helping with his studies<lb/>

                  turned out that the young man lived in my direction, so I took<lb/>
                  him home, and in my car he opened his mouth and spo<del>i</del>ke, and<lb/>
                  what he said became engraved on my mind. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>"Who is Professor<lb/>
                  Auden?" he asked. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>"Tell me about him. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>Is he an important man?"<lb/>
                  <space quantity="5" unit="char"/>This is the cue for a story which, though with names<lb/>
                  omitted, should be placed on record. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>It must have been in<lb/>
                  about 1949 or 1950 that an American woman was travelling by<lb/>
                  train <del>th</del> in Austria. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>In the carriage were two Austrian boys<lb/>
                  in their early teens. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>The three got into conversation, the woman<lb/>
                  asked a number of questions and heard the boys' story. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>Their<lb/>
                  father was an artist, they lived in a village on a lakeside and<lb/>
                  went to the local high school. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>Yes, they would be leaving school<lb/>
                  at fifteen, one of them would go as an apprentice to the local<lb/>
                  printer's. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>No, there was no money for further education, there<lb/>
                  was no grammar school nearby, the family couldn't a<del>c</del>fford boarding<lb/>
                  school fees, nor lodgings. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>Not long after this chance encounter<lb/>
                  the family heard that Auden would like to pay for the boys'<lb/>
                  education. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>They went through grammar school in Innsbruck and<lb/>
                  never looked back; <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>both made swift careers in industry. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>I have<lb/>
                  the impression that Auden did meet the family in later years;<lb/>
                  nothing was ever further from my mind than to bring up the story<lb/>
                  with Auden. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>It was disinterested generosity of a rare order.<lb/>
                  In the light of this kindness to Austrian citizens, it is <del>all</del><lb/>
                  <del>the more</del> sad, and ironical too, that his final years in Austria<lb/>
                  should have brought him into conflict with the tax authorities.<lb/>

                  himself not to be liable for income tax, debts to the fiscus were<lb/>
                  in fact running up to such an extent that a mortgage was placed<lb/>
                  on the property in Kirchstetten. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>The final amount was A.S.<lb/>
                  930,000. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>What this meant to Auden was that instead of being able<lb/>
                  to take things a bit more easily, he had to pay out pretty well<lb/>
                  all that he had put on one side, and return to the lecture circuit<lb/>
                  in the States, a prospect which he viewed with dread.<lb/>
                  <space quantity="5" unit="char"/>"Do you know" he said to me, "they're accusing me of having<lb/>
                  been inspired by the Austrian landscape! <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>The Weinheber poem and<lb/>
                  all that." <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>I said: <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>"You wrote the poem in Berlin" and he<lb/>
                  shrugged. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>At that time I had no idea how serious the whole thing<lb/>
                  was. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>As <del>r</del>the result of an appeal in high quarters the sum <del>a</del>was<lb/>
                  reduced by about half, and was fully paid up. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>At some point, the<lb/>
                  document is undated, Auden composed a statement, consisting of<lb/>
                  three pages of typescript, giving his point of view in this<lb/>
                  extraordinary aff<del>q</del>air. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>One day, if the whole official correspondence<lb/>
                  is published, t<del>i</del>his document with the rest will be numbered among<lb/>

                  literature and that a road in Kirchstetten had been named after<lb/>
                  him (he requested the local authorities, by the way, not to do so<lb/>
                  until after his death, but they disregarded his wish) he continued:<lb/>
                  <space quantity="5" unit="char"/>"You go on to say, correctly, that I have written a few<lb/>

                  observations:<lb/>

               <p>
                  2. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>I believe you are not aware how it is that poems are<lb/>
                  written. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>What is generally taken to be the subject is only<lb/>
                  a point of view, an occasion, in order to give expression to<lb/>
                  certain thoughts about nature, about God, history, mankind etc.<lb/>
                  <del>qhixh rhw powr <unclear>m</unclear> </del> which the poet may have had in his head for<lb/>
                  a very long time. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>I wrote a poem, for instance, for the 20th<lb/>
                  anniversary of the death of Josef Weinheber. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>But basically,<lb/>
                  the poem has to do with other things: <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>firstly with the love<lb/>
                  which every good poet, of whatever nationality he may be, has<lb/>
                  for his mother tongue, and secondly with what has happened<lb/>
                  since the war in the countries that lost it, that is to say,<lb/>
                  not only Austria, but also Germany and Italy.<lb/>
                  <space quantity="5" unit="char"/>Then again: <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>in 1964 I wrote a poem with the ti<del>e</del>tle<lb/>
                  <del>"</del><unclear>'</unclear>Whitsunday in Kirchstetten<del>"</del><unclear>'</unclear> because I happened to be there<lb/>
                  at the time. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>But the place is unimportant. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>What this poem is<lb/>
                  actually about is the question: <space quantity="1" unit="char"/><del>"</del><unclear>'</unclear>What is the significance<lb/>
                  for a Christian of the Feast of Pen<del>e</del>tecost<del><unclear>?</unclear></del>?' <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>And this applies<lb/>
                  to all countries alike.<lb/>
                  3. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>I believe that you fail t<del>u</del>o understand the financial situation<lb/>
                  of a poet. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>A novelist can, if he is successful, earn a good<lb/>
                  deal of money with his books. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>A p<del><unclear>e</unclear></del>oet cannot do that, even if he<lb/>
                  is very well known, because poems are only read by a minority.<lb/>
                  Far and awa<del>s</del>y the greater part of my income derives, therefore,<lb/>
                  not from the sale of my volumes of verse, but from book reviews,<lb/>
                  translations, lectures etc., activities which have nothing to do<lb/>
                  with Austria. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>And while on the subject of translations: <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>you<lb/>
                  say correctly, that I have a great interest in German and Austri<del>q</del>an<lb/>
                  literature - I might add, also in its music, but I have no need<lb/>
                  to come to Austria to read or to hear them."<lb/>

                  Austria, and concludes:<lb/>

                  <space quantity="5" unit="char"/>The news reached me over the car radio on the motorway near<lb/>
                  Linz, and I headed straight for Kirchstetten on the off-chance<lb/>
                  that Chester might already have come home. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>Wystan had died in<lb/>
                  the night of 28/29 September, and the fact blotted out all else.<lb/>

                  Society for Literature? <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>I had talked it over with him a few<lb/>
                  days earlier, saying t<del>ä</del>hat I was exasperated at finding myself<lb/>
                  committed to a meeting in Linz which I yearned to cut<unclear>;</unclear><lb/>

                  perhaps spend the night there. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>I was glum, and he cheered me<lb/>
                  up, saying that I'd heard it all before, and I must come over<lb/>
                  afterwards and he'd tell me how it had gone off.<lb/>
                  <space quantity="5" unit="char"/>There was all too much time on the motorway to react, and I<lb/>

                  <space quantity="5" unit="char"/>The green shutters on the door at Kirchstetten were closed,<lb/>
                  and there was no one there. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>I wrote a note and stuck it in the<lb/>

                  calle<del>e</del>d Adolf Opel, and an assortment of unidentified young people.<lb/>
                  The expressions on the faces of the chief protagonists in what was<lb/>
                  clearly a heated discussion were not quite what one would expect<lb/>
                  at a gathering of mourners and local worthies who had come to<lb/>
                  offer their condolences. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>The mayor was looking stubborn, <del>the</del><lb/>
                  Frau Seitz looked worried, the Clarks puzzled. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>Chester was hardly<lb/>

               <p>
                  <space quantity="5" unit="char"/>Chester tried to explain, and gradually his wishes became<lb/>
                  clear. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>He hated everything in the shape of pompes funèbres.<lb/>
                  He wanted Wyst<del>o</del>an buried quietly and at once, if possible on<lb/>
                  Tuesday, telegrams had been sent to John Auden, to Stephen<lb/>
                  Spender and others telling them to come on Tuesday morning or<lb/>
                  earlier. <space quantity="2" unit="char"/>The mayor, Chester said, wanted a big funeral at the<lb/>
                  following weekend, with the town band out, a hearse coming to<lb/>
                  the door, representatives of the Ministry of Education, the <hi rend="underline">Land</hi><lb/>
                  and all the rest of it. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>He, Chester, couldn't bear it and<lb/>
                  wouldn't have it. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>Knowing Austrian burial customs it was evident<lb/>
                  t<del>t</del>hat we were faced with a cultural clash of no mean proportions.<lb/>
                  A hurried private funeral of the kind envisaged by Chester might<lb/>
                  seem normal <del>to</del> in western intellectual circles. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>In Austria it<lb/>
                  was an affront to the decencies and carried a whiff of pauperism,<lb/>
                  suicide or both. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>Now the mayor had his say. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>"First of all" he<lb/>
                  said, "the body has not yet been released. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>As in all cases of<lb/>
                  sudden death in a hotel, where the circumstances are not wholly<lb/>
                  clear, there has had to be an inquest, and even with intervention,<lb/>
                  these things take time." <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>And then: <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>"Imagine not even informing<lb/>
                  the ministry, the department of culture of the <hi rend="underline">Land</hi> government -<lb/>
                  it would be more than my job is worth." <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>Frau Seitz now gave it as<lb/>
                  her view that Kirchstetten would hardly bury a dog in the w<del>q</del>ay<lb/>
                  intended by Herr <del>H</del>Kallman, let alone a major poet, a man moreover<lb/>
                  whom they had all known and loved.<lb/>
                  <space quantity="5" unit="char"/>The discussion continued, the young people drifted like<lb/>
                  autumn leaves hither and thither, whispering and bearing bottles.<lb/>
                  Frau Strobl made frequent dramatic entrances for reasons which<lb/>
                  were never quite clear. <space quantity="2" unit="char"/>It was not, it occurred to us, only a<lb/>
                  question of when and how much, but: <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>what kind of a funeral service<lb/>
                  should it be? <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>Auden was a practising member of the Church of<lb/>
                  England§- or of the Episcopalian Church in the States - but he<lb/>
                  had regularly attended Mass in the Catholic Church of Kirchstetten<lb/>
                  and had wished to be buried there. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>Should not the Anglican<lb/>
                  chaplain in Vienna be asked to participate? <space quantity="2" unit="char"/><gap reason="illegible"/>No one seemed to<lb/>
                  have any ideas, but it was finally agreed that an ecumenical<lb/>
                  service would be appropriate, the texts to be spoken being left to<lb/>
                  John Auden to decide in conjunction with the clergy.

               <p>
                  <space quantity="5" unit="char"/>The room was stifling. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>It seemed that Chester needed to<lb/>
                  have fewer people around him and that the party needed to be<lb/>
                  broken up. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>The chance came when Chester agreed to have the<lb/>
                  funeral postponed. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>If my memory of events is correct, agreement<lb/>
                  was first reached only over the vital point that Tuesday was<lb/>
                  impossible and that people in England should be notified at once,<lb/>
                  leaving the final date over for the moment. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>This decision<lb/>
                  conveniently created a natural pause, and now the Clarks undertook<lb/>
                  to send the telegrams and were driven to the <del>P</del>post <del>O</del>office by Frau<lb/>
                  Strobl. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>We all stood up, Chester came over and asked me to<lb/>
                  carry on discussions for the funeral arrangements with the may<del>r</del>or<lb/>
                  and Frau Seitz. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>It was all, he said, more than he could bear,<lb/>
                  I must just try to hold the others in check but he would agree<lb/>
                  to anything I said. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>He was all right really, <del>he said</del> he was<lb/>
                  full to the brim with tranquillisers and only needed a bit of peace.<lb/>
                  We hugged each other warmly and, together with the mayor, I left<lb/>
                  in Frau Seitz's car and we drove to her house at the other end of<lb/>
                  the village.<lb/>
                  <space quantity="5" unit="char"/>This was not the sort of talk in which one can whip through<lb/>
                  the a<del>v</del>genda, and we took our time. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>If only Chester had realised<lb/>
                  it, compared with the style in which an Austrian <del>i</del>village carries<lb/>
                  its senior citizens to the grave, what he was being asked to<lb/>
                  consent to was not a tall order. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>There would be no voluntary<lb/>
                  fire brigade, no gamekeepers with their ancient ritual and their<lb/>
                  wishes for good hunting in the fields of Elysium bellowed into the<lb/>
                  open grave, no linesmen from the local railway, no representatives<lb/>
                  of the local football club, marksmen's association et al.<lb/>
                  And since none of them would be there, they would not have to be<lb/>
                  fed afterwards. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>All the mayor wanted was the brass band; <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>I felt<lb/>
                  that Wystan would have been amused, and might, if he were watching,<lb/>
                  even enjoy it, and I agreed. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>Thursday was chosen to keep down<lb/>
                  the number of idle onlookers, a great concession for which I was<lb/>
                  grateful. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>Chester had told me that he had a phobia about hearses<lb/>
                  being brought to the door. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>What he wanted was for the coffin to<lb/>
                  be carried to the bottom of the hill, if not further, and only then<lb/>
                  placed in the hearse. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>But the thought of the weighty coffin<lb/>
                  being carried down a narrow lane, pitted with ruts and potholes<lb/>
                  and strewn with loose stones, made my hair stand on end. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>The<lb/>
                  mayor and Frau Seitz felt the same wa<del>s</del>y, and here too, Chester<lb/>
                  later agreed to our compromise. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>Subsequently, I was to blame<lb/>
                  myself very m<del>z</del>uch for not raising the qu<del>4</del>estion of who was to <del>play</del>

               </p>
               <p>
                  pay for the band. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>As Chester was being compelled to comply with<lb/>
                  local customs, and the district council in the person of its mayor<lb/>
                  wished to honour a citizen who had brought it great fame, it never<lb/>
                  occurred to me that it was not free of charge. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>Nor did it occur<lb/>
                  to Chester, whose anger at being sent in a bill precipitated a chain<lb/>
                  of events which badly hampered the efforts of the Society for<lb/>
                  Literature to preserve the house as a place of memorial for W.H. Auden.<lb/>
                  At the time, however, we thought we had troubles enough, and the<lb/>
                  misunderstanding was born.<lb/>
                  <space quantity="5" unit="char"/>Meanwhile the mayor was worrying about something else altogethe<del>e</del>r:<lb/>
                  the safety of Auden's manuscripts and papers in the attic room.<lb/>
                  Altogether, he took a distrustful view of the fate of the house and<lb/>
                  everything in it once Chester went back to Athens. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>He was afraid<lb/>
                  that in his state of despair and nervous exhaustion Chester might<lb/>
                  agree to almost anything that was suggested to him with sufficient<lb/>
                  force or calculation. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>But to pursue this subject further <del>is to<del>o</del> </del>would be to<lb/>
                  reach out too far beyond the death of Auden.<lb/>
                  <space quantity="5" unit="char"/>When I got back to the house it was to find Chester in a calmer<lb/>
                  frame of mind and body and able to talk in that gentle and<lb/>
                  affectionate way, with occasional burst of sardonic humour, which<lb/>
                  his friends will remember, overlooking all else.<lb/>
                  <space quantity="5" unit="char"/>In attempting a memoir of Auden in his latter years it would be<lb/>
                  unreasonable to leave Chester Kallman to play a purely walking on<lb/>
                  part, the more so as in articles by visitors to Kirchstetten<lb/>
                  Chester was invariably the fall-<del>f</del>guy. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>It would be very difficult <del>for</del><lb/>
                  full<del>s</del>y to understand the relationship between Auden and Kallman, and<lb/>
                  it never seemed to me that it was any business of mine to try to do so.<lb/>
                  But I saw something of Chester without Wystan<del>´</del>: <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>during the winter<lb/>
                  that he spent alone in Vienna in a flat in the Esslar<del>h</del>ngasse not far<lb/>
                  from my own, and when he was in hospital in St.Pölten for treatment.<lb/>
                  He was a person full of contrasts where vulgarity and second-rate<lb/>
                  humour and tastes lived side by side<del>e</del> with a remarkable personal<lb/>
                  sensitivity and with talent and discrimination in the <del>e</del>spheres of<lb/>
                  literature and music. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>It seems clear from their writings alone,<lb/>
                  that when both men went their own wa<del>s</del>ys in sexual matters, Auden's<lb/>
                  heart was not involved, whereas Kallman's <del>h</del>relationship with Jean<lb/>
                  Boras was both passionate and emotionally degrading. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>Both men<lb/>
                  needed each other and perhaps it would have been better if Chester

                  squalor; <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>together, they kept the pot boiling and the stove<lb/>
                  crackling. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>The daily routine was maintained, drink disciplined<lb/>
                  and loneliness banished. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>When Boras died, Auden wondered how<lb/>
                  Kallman would get through the Austrian summer. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>When Auden died,<lb/>
                  Kallman pined away.<lb/>
                  <space quantity="5" unit="char"/>The gathering in the livingroom on the eve of the funeral<lb/>
