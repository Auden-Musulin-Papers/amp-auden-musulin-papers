                  Dear Stella,
               </p>
               <p>
                  Delighted you got that EARLY AUDEN, and even more delighted you find<lb/>
                  it worth looking into. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/><del>As I suppose you've experienced yourself,</del>Is it a universal experience among authors to<lb/>
                  be surprised that someone actually reads one's book?  I'm so familiar<lb/>
                  with the thing by now, and so aware of its deficiencies, that I wish<lb/>
                  I could recall the edition and rewrite the whole <del>thing from</del>book from the start.<lb/>
                  Luckily, t<del>h</del>eaching, reviewing and miscellaneous annoyances keep the<lb/>
                  mind elsewhere. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>One of those miscellaneous annoy<del><gap reason="deleted"/></del>ances was a move<lb/>
                  from my o<del>d</del>ld flat to an<del>t</del>other one on the same floor in the same building.<lb/>
                  The new address is up above, and the only change is in the apartment<lb/>
                  number. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>Phone number still 212 222-0679.
               </p>
               <p>
                  Yes, I saw the you<del>g</del>ng man who was doing advance work f<del>ro</del>or Robert Robinson,<lb/>
                  but haven't heard from him since July. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>I gather <del>wor</del>that work progresses,<lb/>
                  though. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>There was an hour on Wystan on BBC <hi rend="underline"></hi>Radio the other week--a<lb/>
                  "dramatization" with an actor reading the poems and lots of ominous<lb/>
                  <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>noises off. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>I'm told it was fairly dreadful, but perh<del><gap reason="deleted"/></del>aps the TV film<lb/>
                  will be better. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>I saw quite a good one from the BBC on Benjamin Britten.<lb/>
                  Its only fault--and I'm not sure <del><gap reason="deleted"/></del>this was a fault, given the usual tone<lb/>
                  of TV journalism--was an awed tone of worship.
               </p>
               <p>
                  <del>A</del>Easy answers to important questions. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>Those two volumes <del><gap reason="deleted"/>f</del>by and about<lb/>
                  Auden sound very attractive. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>(Which publisher is interested?) <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>The<lb/>
                  place to write for permissions is to the agents, specifically, to<lb/>

                  anyway.
               </p>
               <p>
                  Now let me beg you for an easy answer. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>I've heard from at<del>t<gap reason="deleted"/></del> least two<lb/>
                  different people that they had seen (or knew someone else who had seen)<lb/>
                  a German text of your Wystan memoir in print. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>Are they right, or are<lb/>
                  they confusing this with an occasion when you read it aloud (and it was<lb/>
                  reported)? <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>I had an Austrian student here this summer working on Wystan,<lb/>
                  and I wanted to tell her about the piece, but didn't know where to find<lb/>
                  it. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>Please, <hi rend="underline">please</hi> tell me if you printed it, and if so, where. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>No need<lb/>
                  for a long letter: just a "No, calm down, I never printed it" or a "Yes,<lb/>
                  it appeared in such-in-such a journal" would be more than enough. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>This is<lb/>
                  the one min<del><gap reason= "deleted"/></del>or mystery of writings-about-Wystan I haven't been able to solve,<lb/>
                  so please do help.
               </p>
               <p>
                  Have I told you <del><gap reason="deleted"/>ny</del>any of my news? <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>I'm now at Columbia University permanently,<lb/>
                  if I want to be. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>I have a flat with a small guest room and bath--so please<lb/>
                  take note if you're in th<del>e</del>is country for any reason. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>I have a lady friend,<lb/>
                  the first whom I expect to be with for a very long time, and we are quite<lb/>
                  happy about things in general. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>Next June we'll be in Europe, certainly in<lb/>

                  although I don't like to imagine how Wystan would have taken it.
