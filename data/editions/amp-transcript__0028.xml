                  <space quantity="5" unit="char"/>My position is very simple: one pays income tax where one<lb/>

                  You maintain that I possess a "material interest" in <rs type="place" ref="#amp_place_id_10">Austria</rs>,<lb/>
                  by which you presumably mean a "financial" interest. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>That might<lb/>

                  <space quantity="10" unit="char"/>expressed which the poet may have had in mind for a very<lb/>
