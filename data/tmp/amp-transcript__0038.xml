                  JOSHPH WEINHEBER
                  SSe-TSI
                  Reaching my gate a narrow
                  Lane from the village
                  Passes on into a wood:
                  When I walk that way
                  It seems becoming to stop
                  And look through the fence
                  Of your garden where (under
                  The circs they had to)
                  They buried you like a loved
                  Old family dog.
                  Categorised enemies
                  Twenty years ago
                  Now next-door neighbors, we might
                  Have become good friends,
                  Sharing a common ambit
                  And love of the word,
                  Over a golden Kremser
                  Had many a long
                  Language on syntax, commas,
                  Versification.
                  Yes,yes, it has to be said:
                  Men of great damage
                  And malengine took you up.
                  Did they, though, ever
                  Take you in, who to Goebbels'
                  Offer of culture
                  Countered In Ruah lassen!?
                  But the crowd prefers
                  A nasty stink and the young
                  Condemn you unread.
                  What, had you ever heard of
                  Franz Jägerstätter,
                  The St.Radegund peasant
                  Who said his lonely
                  Nein to the Aryan State
                  And was beheaded,
                  Would your heart, as Austrian,
                  As poet, have told you?
                  Good care, of course, was taken
                  You should hear nothing,
                  Be unprepared for a day
                  That was bound to come,
                  A season of dread and tears
                  And dishevelment
                  When, transfixed by a nightmare,
                  You destroyed yourself.
                  Retribution was ever
                  A bungler at it:
                  Dies alles ist furchtbar, hier
                  Nur Schweigen gemäss.
               </p>

               <p>
                  Unmarked by me, unmourned for,
                  The hour of your death,
                  Unhailed by you the moment
                  When,providence-led,
                  I first beheld Kirchstetten
                  On a pouring wet
                  October day in a year
                  That changed our Cosmos,
                  The annus mirabilis
                  When Parity fell.
                  Already the realms that lost
                  Were properly warm
                  And over-eating, their crimes
                  The pedestrian
                  Private sort, those nuisances,
                  Corpses and rubble,
                  Long carted away: for their raped
                  The shock was fading,
                  Their kidnapped physicists felt
                  No longer homesick.
                  To-day we smile at weddings
                  Where bride and bridegroom
                  Were both born since the Shadow
                  Lifted, or rather
                  Moved elsewhere. Never as yet
                  Has Earth been without
                  Her bad patch, some unplace with
                  Jobs for torturers
                  (In what bars are they welcome?
                  What girls marry them?),
                  Or her nutritive surface
                  At peace all over.
                  No one, so far as we know,
                  Has ever been safe,
                  And so in secret regions
                  Good family men
                  Keep eye, devoted as monks,
                  On apparatus
                  Inside which harmless matter
                  Turns homicidal.
                  Here, though, I feel as at home
                  As you did: the same
                  Short-lived creatures re-utter
                  The same care-free songs,
                  Orchards cling to the regime
                  They know,from April's
                  Rapid augment of color
                  Till boisterous Fall
                  When at each stammering gust
                  Apples thump the ground.

                  Humanely modest in scale
                  And mild in contour,

                  Neighbor and colleague,
                  For even my English ear
                  Gets in your German
                  The workmanship and the note
                  Of one who was graced
                  To hear the viols playing
                  On the impaled green,
                  Committed thereafter den

                  Dear Stella:
                  Kirchstetten is intending to have a ceremony in memory of the twentieth
                  anniversary of Weinheber', death. Herewith my effort to do my
                  Gemeindepflicht.
