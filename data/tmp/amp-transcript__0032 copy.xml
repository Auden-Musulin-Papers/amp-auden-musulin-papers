                  1 December 1980
                  
                  
                  Dear Stella,
                  I just got back from a month in England to find your letter. I was
                  rather worried as to how you were, and am delighted to hear that
                  you're on the ascent after a "decline." I'm also abashed not to have
                  been in touch with you before about the collapse of our four-memoir
                  book, but the whole thing has been farcical and uncertain. Here are
                  the basics. First, there should be no need to repay any of the
                  advance (I haven't spoken with Random House about this, except with
                  an ill-informed assitant, but there shouldn't be any problem), and
                  second, I hope you haven't gone out of your way to work on the thing
                  again. The structure collapsed in two or three stages. First Lincoln
                  Kirstein read the forthcoming biography by Humphrey Carpenter (not bad,
                  not spectacularly good), and decided he didn't know enough Auden to
                  add new facts, that he wasn't really worthy to be a memoirist, etc.
                  None of this has any truth, but Kirstein is not a person to argue with.
                  He managed to persuade me, in September, that the book should at least
                  be left to stew for a while. Then Spender finally sent in a first
                  draft of his piece, which, between us, was a disaster. At this time
                  Charles Monteith had a look at it, and agreed. When I saw Charles
                  in London a couple of weeks ago, we formally let the thing drop, and
                  I think he already wrote you about it.
                  I still think your piece is first-rate (the copyright is yours, by the
                  way), and I hope you'll publish it, perhaps with a word or two of
                  information from Christa Esders if that's possible. (Did you learn
                  anything from her??) If you want me to try to place it in this country,
                  I'll do my best with it. Do let me know. I feel very sorry that you
                  went to all this trouble for—up to now-nothing, and for many reasons
                  I should like to see the piece in print.
                  No, I haven't got to Vienna for five years now, and couldn't afford
                  a visit this year. Next summer, if my job is sorted out, I would very
                  much like to come over again. This past summer I tried ringing you a
                  few times at 4217175, but got no reply. Is that your number? Mine here
                  is 212 222-0679 if there's ever a reason to need it.
                  Please do forgive me for the muddle over the book. And please do keep
                  in touch. Incidentally I finished that critical book-to be published
                  in the spring-after doing nothing but work on it for a year. My "summer"
                  trip to England got postponed to November while I revised.
                  Yours ever,
