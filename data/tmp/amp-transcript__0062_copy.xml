                  <space quantity="5" unit="char"/>Half an hour from the outskirts of Vienna an invisible<lb/>
                  thread bisect<del>x</del>s the motorway. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>It leads from the church which<lb/>
                  lies to the north, more accurately speaking from the churchyard,<lb/>
                  disregards entirely the traffic as it thunders to and from the<lb/>
                  capital, wriggles across a field to the south, passes a small<lb/>
                  house which was once a garage. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>Up a steep path, plum trees<lb/>
                  on one side and apple trees on the other, through a wicket<lb/>
                  gate, and now the thread, which has turned neither to right nor<lb/>
                  left, has reached its objective: <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>a long, low house, more an<lb/>
                  extended workman's cottage. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/><unclear>O</unclear>riginally, the address was<lb/>
                  Hinterhol<del>6</del>z 6; <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>later, the lane up from the village on the other<lb/>
                  side was renamed Auden-Strasse. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>This thread or unseen line joins<lb/>
                  the places where Auden prayed, sang (flat) and was buried, and<lb/>
                  the place where he lived, and to me it is tangible reality,<lb/>
                  unfailingly sensed at each frequent crossing. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>Partly it is<lb/>
                  because it was alwa<del>s</del>ys from that direction that I arrived, being<lb/>
                  mistrustful of the narrow lane which lies along the top of the<lb/>
                  garden and leads into a wood where in a small clearing floored<lb/>
                  at times by sticky mud, the car can be turned. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/><unclear>I</unclear>t seemed<lb/>
                  preferable, and anyway became a habit, to take the cart track<lb/>
                  <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>through the field with its ruts, the depth of which left the<lb/>
                  undercarriage to slide along the plateau of coarse grass. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>And<lb/>
                  to leave the car by the garage and plod up throug<unclear>h</unclear> the orchard,<lb/>
                  accepting the risk of slithering off the path to the right.<lb/>
                  <space quantity="5" unit="char"/>On walking through the wicket-gate next to the woodshed,<lb/>
                  there has been from time to time, and is today, the risk of<lb/>
                  being savaged by a wall-eyed dog; <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>in earlier days, of having<lb/>
                  to account for ones presence to Frau Emma. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>Past the vegetable<lb/>
                  patc<unclear>h</unclear>, now the ground levels off and the house stands before us.<lb/>
                  Left, at the foot of the outside staircase and below the window of<lb/>
                  his workroom, t<unclear>h</unclear>ere are the white table and comfortable garden<lb/>
                  chairs with red cushions. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>Facing the caller, the green door with<lb/>
                  a bell, the sort whic<unclear>h</unclear> jangles when pulled. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>I seldom did so,<lb/>
                  fee<unclear>l</unclear>ing that its clamour spoke of altogether too much aggressive<lb/>
                  jocularity. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>Seeing the light through the sittingroom window, it was<lb/>
                  better to walk straight in to the small entrance hall - coats hanging

                  on the wall ahead, kitchen through the right-hand door, a clutter<lb/>
                  of books and papers on a nearby ledge - and to shout. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>That<lb/>
                  heartwarming bellow from Wystan: <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>"Ah!" and here is the familiar<lb/>
                  scene, we are enveloped in the unchanging fug. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>The shelves<lb/>
                  of re<del>f</del>cords and the oversized record player on the left, the<lb/>
                  big, square dining table with its food-stained cloth. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>Centre<lb/>
                  back, the Austrian peasant cupboard containing drinks, sugar,<lb/>
                  salt, then the corner seat, the table with its cigarette burns<lb/>
                  and glass rings, and two arm<unclear>-</unclear>chairs - a <hi rend="underline">Sitzecke.</hi> <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>To our right<lb/>
                  a tumble of assorted titles on an invisible surface; <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>within a<lb/>
                  matter of days, Auden could make a new book look like a lending<lb/>
                  library reject: <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>the content was all, the package irrelevant.<lb/>
                  Here lie, precariously balanced, collapsing, upended, volumes of<lb/>
                  poetry, cookery books, Benson's Lucia novels, Akenfield, whodunnits<lb/>
                  a new translation of the Bible. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>Over the years, the content of<lb/>
                  the heap varied but the overall appeara<unclear>n</unclear>ce scarcely at all.<lb/>
                  And now the stove, country style, a white dome with round green<lb/>
                  tiles set in it, one of the glories of Austrian <hi rend="underline">Wohnkultur</hi>.<lb/>
                  How fortunate that the stove is irremovable, or it would be in<lb/>
                  Athens now, along with the cupboard and the original drawings of<lb/>
                  Stravinsky and Richard Strauss. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>Books also lie along the top<lb/>
                  ledge of the corner seat, and a volume or two of the OED on the<lb/>
                  upright chairs by the dinner table, adjuncts to the Times<lb/>
                  crossword. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>Was it, I asked, essential to have the complete<lb/>
                  Oxford English Dictionary, all thirteen volumes of it, at each<lb/>
                  of ones residences? <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>"Of cour<del>x</del>se" said Auden, surprised at such a<lb/>
                  question.<lb/>
                  <space quantity="5" unit="char"/>So much was written during his lifetime about Auden's<lb/>
                  way of life in Kirchstetten: <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>articles by capable journalists<lb/>
                  in the Sunday papers and in their weekly magazines, that any<lb/>
                  attempt at a personal memoir gives the writer the feeling that<lb/>
                  he is working all too well-trodden ground.<lb/>
                  <space quantity="5" unit="char"/>It is not only that the scene is familiar. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>What can a friend<lb/>
                  write withou<del>g</del>t lapsing into triviality and gossip, without calling<lb/>
                  down on his head the wrath of Wystan Auden himself, about whom,

               <p>
                  if we know nothing else, we realise the obsession that he had<lb/>
                  on the subject of personal privacy. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>Think <del>of</del>for a moment of<lb/>
                  "Forewords and Afterwords": <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>ag<unclear>a</unclear>in and again he writes on<lb/>
                  these lines: <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>Of Wagner: <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>"On principle, I object to biographies<lb/>
                  of artists, since <unclear>I</unclear> do not believe th<unclear>a</unclear>t knowledge of their<lb/>
                  private lives <unclear>s</unclear>heds <unclear>a</unclear>ny significant light upon their works."<lb/>
                  And on Oscar Wilde: <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>"Since know<del>o</del>ledge of an artist's private li<del>r</del>fe<lb/><!-- how transcribe displaced characters? -->
                  never throws any significant light upon his work, there is no<lb/>
                  justification for intruding upon his privacy." <space quantity="2" unit="char"/>Listening to<lb/>
                  Kurt Weill records one winter's evening in Chester's flat in the<lb/>
                  Esslarngasse, I asked him whether he could account for it.<lb/>
                  Disappointingly, Chester only said that it was an obsession with<lb/>
                  Wystan, a<del>j</del>n individual phobia like any other. <space quantity="2" unit="char"/>The only time that<lb/>
                  Auden ever came near to snapping at me was when he spoke once,<lb/>
                  affectionately, of Tolkien, saying that he was to speak or write<lb/>
                  about him. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>Was he, I asked, going to say anything at all about<lb/>
                  the man as the creator of the world of Tolkien, of the Lord of the<lb/>
                  Rings<del>,</del>? <del>and</del> <del>h</del>He said "Certainly not! <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>I shouldn't dream of saying<lb/>
                  anything about Tolkien himself." <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>So that the predicament is<lb/>
                  understood : <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>either we keep silent when asked to speak <del>o</del>and write<lb/>
                  about Auden, which might seem a trifle portentous, not to say<lb/>
                  uncivil. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>Or <del>w</del>else we run the dual risk of trivi<del>li</del><unclear>a</unclear>lity or indiscretio<unclear>n.</unclear><lb/>
                  In the eyes of <del>those</del>other<unclear>s</unclear> who knew him <del>best</del>better, there is probably a<lb/>
                  further risk, that of being coupled with the German mythical<lb/>
                  figure, the hor<del><unclear>e</unclear></del>seman who rode, as he supposed, over the frozen<lb/>
                  Lake of Constance, unaware that this was not the case at all, but<lb/>
                  he was being carried along above dark waters, knowing nothing<lb/>
                  of the treacherous depths beneath him. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>So that my contribution<lb/>
                  can be no more than an attempt to show how Auden lived among the<lb/>
                  Austrians, on what sort of terms he was with them, and perhaps<lb/>
                  to fill in one or two gaps in what is generally known.<lb/>
                  <space quantity="5" unit="char"/>I got to know Wystan and Chester through <del>Chris</del> the daughter<lb/>
                  of Hugo von Hofmannsthal, Christiane Zimmer, who was a friend of<lb/>
                  Auden's in New York. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>Gerty von Hofmannsthal, widow of the poet, who died in 1929,<lb/>

                  turn of the fifties, and t<del>e</del>here she spent her summers until she<lb/>
                  died, filling the house with her friends, often like herself Anglo-Austrian<lb/>
                  émigrés - the writers, artists and scholars who had lived and<lb/>
                  worked in Vienna during the twilight of that great explosion of<lb/>
                  talent which coincided with the decline and end of the Austro-<lb/>
                  Hungarian Empire. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>Raimund and Liz von Hofmannsthal were often<lb/>
                  there, with their children Arabella and Octavian. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>There was<lb/>
                  a constant coming and going between Pri<del>l</del>elau and the rehearsals<lb/>
                  and then the performances of the Salzburg Festival; <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>it was a<lb/>
                  great meeting place for retired birds of paradise such as Lady<lb/>
                  Diana Cooper, <del>X</del> Ledebur and the dancer and choreographer Grete Wiesenthal. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>Gradually, a well-<lb/>
                  worn track developed between Prielau and our house at the upper<lb/>
                  end of the Schmittenhöhe valley, and friendships <del>developed</del>grew between<lb/>
                  my family and the Hofmannsthals and several of their friends<lb/>
                  which have survived and have been continued by our children.<lb/>
                  My marriage broke up during 1957-58 and my son Marko and I went<lb/>
                  to live with my mother-in-law Els<del><unclear>e</unclear></del>a Musulin at her home Schloss Fridau,<lb/>

                  met Christiane Zimmer at Prielau, and she suggested I should call<lb/>
                  on Auden: <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>"After all, he's your neighbour now". <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>I demurred with<lb/>
                  some energy, having a great di<del>l</del>slike of pursuing the famous<lb/>
                  except inthe way of business where an interview i<del>f</del>s called for.<lb/>
                  The next time I saw her - in 1959 - she asked whether I had seen<lb/>
                  Auden, I again scoffed at the very idea that he might "love to<lb/>
                  meet me", and she said "All right. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>I'm just off to spend a<lb/>
                  week there now and I shall fix it <del>up</del> ."<lb/>
                  So in due course I <del>du</del> came to be standing at the green door,<lb/>

                  <space quantity="5" unit="char"/>"Thank goodness you've come" he hissed, "go and look after<lb/>

                  went on they became his friends. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>Their composure that day was,<lb/>
                  I am sure, partly due to their own personal qualities, but<lb/>
                  partly too to the fact that in Josef Weinheber they had had<lb/>
                  their local poet laureate before, and now they had one again.<lb/>
                  This was a cause for great satisfaction, but not for any transports<lb/>

                  There was a tidy row <del>o</del>consisting of a fridge, sink, low cupboards<lb/>
                  with a good working surface, a corner cupboard the interior of<lb/>
                  which swung out, and a gas stove. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>Both men were very proud of<lb/>
                  the kitchen and it became Chester's habitat. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/><del><gap reason="deleted"/></del>But the whole<lb/>
                  point of a modern kitchen: <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>the clear surfaces, ample storage<lb/>

                  cancelled out by the permanent clutter which invaded the <del>kitchen</del>room<lb/>
                  at once and never left it. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>It was a matter of principle with<lb/>
                  Chester to have all cooking ingredients conveniently to hand,<lb/>
                  but this meant that nothing was ever put away, and where his<lb/>

                  <space quantity="5" unit="char"/>The small heap of correspondence lying on the filing cabinet<lb/>
                  beside my desk puts me in mind of the rise and fall of the<lb/>
                  telegram as a means of social communication. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>In English novels<lb/>
                  during the period up to and even well beyond the first world war -<lb/>
                  particularly in detective stories - the in<del><gap reason="deleted"/></del>cessant despatc<unclear>h</unclear> and<lb/>
                  receipt of telegrams, often of some lengt<unclear>h</unclear>, play a prominent<lb/>
                  part in human relationships. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>They were an <del>s</del>astonishingly rapid<lb/>
                  and comparatively inexpensive medium of communication and were<lb/>
                  often emplo<del>x</del>yed over short distances. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>In Austria, the reign of<lb/>
                  the telegram persisted into the sixties, lost ground sharply<lb/>
                  owing to automatisation, but enjoyed one last indian summer in<lb/>
                  the <del>P</del>post <del>O</del>office at Kirchstetten. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>There was no telephone in the<lb/>
                  house at Holzweg 5 because of the distance from the nearest point<lb/>
                  of contact; <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>it would have been too expensive to instal. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>Also,<lb/>
                  Auden liked his peace and quiet and when he wanted to telephone<lb/>
                  he did so from the post office, combining with his daily shopping<lb/>
                  expedition. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>The lack of a telephone accounts for much of my<lb/>
                  correspondence with Auden, or rather, because I have only scant<lb/>
                  records of what I wrote, for his letters to me, and especially<lb/>
                  for the telegrams. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>"We are here, where are you?" or "Wednesday<lb/>

                  were roast saddle of roe deer with cranberry preserve,
                  duck or roast pheasant, with a good wine, followed by
                  one of the richer Austrian cakes - Wurmbrand-Torte for ihstance,
                  which consists mainly of ground burnt almonds and creamed chocolatey
                  and then to carry ones wine glass back into the sittingroom and
                  wait while the Turkish coffee ceremony was performed. This was,
                  down all the years that I have known Fridau, and still is, the
                  indkspensable conclusion to lunches even of the humbler, everyday
                  sort: turkish coffee with the kaimak hissing faintly as the cup
                  is filled - that pale brown foam which must be removed as the coffee
                  to the boil and carefully shared out between the empty cups.
                  Failure to do this is the unforgiveable sin.
                  And Auden would sit,
                  well nourished, blinking in the sunsnine from the
                  window opposite him from where he could see the crown of an immense
                  pear tree. After his second cup he was likely to leap to his feet
                  without any of those preliminary movements of eyes, hands and feet
                  with which people signal their imminent departure, shake hands
                  all round and hurry away. But sometimes xx he felt like a turn
                  round the park, or even to stay on for a time, sitting in a deck
                  chair under the trees in the courtyard. But if he hurried, it was
                  no discourtesy; Wystan was the most courteous of men, wgo liked
                  to follow the customs of  the country he lived in, and above all
                  Enlorteli
                  .
                  he had no special voice for inre. He got on well with
                  Austrian people who sometimes - without the natural excuse of
                  his food storeenest. Mark's Place - had no idea of the calibre of
                  the man with whom, in his home or theirs, they were having a meal.
                  As I knew him, the only thing he couldn't bear was pretension.
                  So one would have supposed that writers young and older
                  would have lost no time in beating a path out to Kirchstetten.
                  Are writers convivial creatures? Do they like to congregate
                  together for mutual admiration and to complain about their
                  publishers? At some times and in some places, yes, at others no;
                  that they have the patience to listen to each other reading their
                  works aloud is true, probably, only in circumstances of
                  political persecution. Be it as it may, I sometimes see Auden's
                  relationship with the literary scene in Austria - such as it is
                  as a string of wasted opportunities. He was interviewed, he was

                  filmed, and the Gesellschaft für Literatur did its duty by him
                  and more, from start to finish. It still does. But the Austrian
                  Sociaty for Literature is neigkther a club nor a coffee house
                  but a society for the promotion of literature with a particular
                  mission to writers in communist eastern Europe. Somehow, in the
                  sixties, there was otherwise no group of people, no meeting place
                  towards which Auden himself could naturally gravitate. Think of
                  this in terms of the old pre-war Vienna, the life in the coffee
                  houses where the literary figures of the earlier 20th century
                  congregated, where they spent their days, read their correspondence
                  and the newspapers, read and wrote criticisms, blacked each
                  other's characters: the Cafe Central and the Herrenhof. I can
                  imagine Auden in this atmosphere very well, epjoying the
                  opportunity it gave him of rubbing shoulders with writers of all
                  ages, and particularly with the young, as it were by chance,
                  without further commitment on either side and with the minimum
                  of effort. I can see the cigarette ash on the marble topped
                  tables, the mounds of paper, see Auden slopping to and fro in
                  his eternal bedroom slippers between his table and the
                  telephone kiosk. But this world ended when Egon Friedell,
                  giving the passers by a shouc of warning as he did so, jumped
                  out of the window to his death on the entry of the Nazis. It
                  was a world, described again and again by those who knew it,
                  never more effectively than by one of its last active, working
                  survivors, Friedrich Torberg, and it has gone for ever. Today's
                  writerg have no time. They are dashing from recording studios
                  beyond Schönbrunn to newspaper offices at the opposite end of
                  Vienna, from the head post office to their homes, where they kiss
                  wife and children, snatch a bag and rush to the airport or to
                  a railway terminal.
                  Alternatively, like Thomas Bernhard, they bury themselves
                  in a farmhouse in a district carefully chosen for its unfashion-
                  ableness and difficulty of access, emerging, like cats, only on
                  their own terms, preferring to turn up unannounced in their
                  friends houses, perhaps late at night, enquiring for just that
                  ration of warmth, light and unquestioning acceptance which,
                  at that moment, they happened to need. Bernhard's fame has now
                  altered the character of the district he lives in and he has
                  withdrawn to still more distant quarters. Auden always wanted to

                  meet Bernhard, and asked me to mediate, which I did on several
                  occasions, but to no effect; I think I did overcome Bernhard's
                  disinclination but the moment never arrived
                  The cultural historian Friedrich Heer, on the other hand,
                  asked whether he, would like to go out to lunch in Kirchstetten,
                  Hot Ketonldk
                  replied/- he has a tendency towards hyperbole - "on my knees“.
                  The day is describee in a letter of mine to a friend in Germany,
                  dated 29th May
                  "I still can't put yesterday's expedition to Kirchstetten
                  out of my mind. Fritz Heer and I drove out to lunch. This manic¬
                  depressive genius Friedrich Heer, dieser verschreckter Lausbub,
                  and the great English ppoet Auden - to say nothing of Kallman -
                  how would it go off? It went like a bomb. Fritz was like a man
                  let out of prison. For months at a time he never escapes from the
                  treadmill 3 and he rejoiced so over the soft greens of the Vienna
                  Woods, over the accacia trees whose silver shimmer stood out
                  against the darker background, over the good air, the clear view
                  after the storm of two days ago. I was a bit worried that the
                  two big talkers might both speak at once or at cross purposes,
                  but this only happened occasionally: each really wanted to hear
                  what the other had to say, they exchanged anecdotes and sometimes
                  they moved(forChester and e on to ground where wechesle aa/)
                  couldn't follow them. Each picked up the other's illusions
                  instantly, and the stimmung was wonderful. We were on one of my
                  favourite hobby-horses, the destruction of the German language
                  by the Nazis. But Fritz insisted that Mussolini had vulgarised
                  Italian in the same way, and suddenly he drew himself up, threw
                  out his chest, his face became a live mask of Mussolini and he
                  held forth in in, hectoring, high-pitched tone - a
                  performance which could have been transferred to any cabaret
                  unaltered. I never knew he had such a talent for mimicry. Nor
                  was this all. The conversation moved to France and the Paris
                  intellectuals, and now Eritz topped up his cabaret with a
                  simpering, lovingly luxuriant interchange between Gide and Claudel.
                  Wystan was convulsed.
                  The talk shifted to Wagner's texts, liturgical reform,
                  Weinheber, Rudolf Kassner and Freud; of these three Fritz could
                  speak from personal x knowledge.“ (The letter continues with an
                  § in the Burgtheater, where, such is Austrian logic, he works as &
                  dramatuggist.

                  attempt at an analysis of Heer's character and personality which
                  would be out of place here.
                  Unless Auden had friends to stay, talk of this quality was
                  a rare occurrence. It was possible to see why Bernhard, to take
                  one example, did not care to go to Kirchstetten: there was a
                  kind of gene, and a quite unjustified fear that he would have
                  to speak English. But it is impossible to discern any reason,
                  apart from lack of time, which could have got in the way of
                  personal contact between Auden and his translators. During his
                  early years in Kirchstetten Auden did feel slighted by some of
                  his translators in Austrla and Germany who would publish their
                  work in literary magazines, and if the poet himself ever heard
                  of it, it was by pure chance. „They den't“ he said indignantly,
                  "even send me a copy of their paper“. Nor, in those days, was
                  he satisfied with the quality of the work. We said to an
                  interviewer in Berlin?, at a time when little of his poetry
                  had been translated into German: „Translating poetry into a
                  different language is very very problematical - and apart from
                  that, people earn too little by it.“ But: „Why can't one send
                  the translation to a living poet before it is published?“ He
                  might not know the exactly suitable word, but he would know what
                  image a word or a phrase was intended to call up in the reader.
                  "For instance, I spoke in a poem about corn - maize - but the
                  translator rendered it as wheat! I was annoyed, because that
                  sort of thing can be avoided."
                  The fifty minute drive to Kirchstetten presented too great
                  a psychological barrier even to the young, now dead, author and
                  poet Gerhard Fritsch (he committed suicide) who translated Auden's
                  Christmas Oratorio „For the Time Being“ into German. It was
                  published in 1961 under the siel title „Hier und Jetzt“ (here and
                  now). The translation is no masterpiece, but it was an attempt to
                  demonstrate a style of writing which has always been very English
                  and is characteristic of Auden even within the confines of a
                  stanza: shifts in tone from the lofty to the colloquial. In
                  "For the Time Being“ Auden's language can be surrealistic, every¬
                  day, ironical, grotesque, mocking, tender, full of grief, rising
                  to moments of lyrical joy. Rarely even attempted in German
                  literature, in religious writing tone changes of this description
                  are unknown. Austrian television showed a version of the oratorio
                  on the eve of Epiphany - 5 January 1967 - in which the libretto

                  was adapted and the music written by the composer Paul Kont.
                  A review by the critic Helmut A. Fiechtner in „Die Furche"
                  gives the impression that it was a performance which, like
                  Victorian children, should be seen but not heard. Design and
                  costumes were by one of Austria's leading painters of the
                  postwar era, Anton Lehmden, singers of the calibre of Gloria
                  Davy and Hilde Rössel-Majdan did their best, but the music was
                  unconvincing, it got in the way of the text, and the most
                  impressive passage, not surprisingly, was Helmut Qualtinger's
                  monologue as Herod. In the following year there was a reading
                  of „Hier und Jetzt“ in the Palais Palffy under the auspices of
                  the Society for Literature. Auden read a short passage in
                  English and an actor took over and read in German. It appears
                  that Auden was not satisfied, as he kept muttering "Nonsense
                  completely wrong!“ and making notes in the margin.
                  In later years things changed very much for the better, and
                  although Auden did not actually live to see the volume
                  „Gedichte - Poems“ published in English and German in Vienna
                  in 1973, he did check the proofs, and a few of the translators
                  had been to see him. Today. more of Auden's poetry exists in
                  German than in any other foreign language.
                  Talking of translations: whatever became of the Ford
                  Foundation translation scheme? At one time Auden was
                  thinking about a plan in which he had become involved. This
                  was to bring

                  all the main literary works in the German language under review
                  in so far as they exist in English translation, to judge their
                  quality and to discover the gaps. The real purpose of the
                  exercise was one with which Auden wholly agreed: to encourage
                  professional writers of the first category to take part in the
                  re-creation of German literature in English. To this end the
                  Ford Foundation would make funds available. Even at that time,
                  for a publisher to have native poetry on his lists showed
                  idealism enough. A translation fee usually wiped out any
                  conceivable profits on literary prose texts or poetry. Nothing,
                  of course, came of the scheme. Why, I don't know; we had
                  a lot of fun making lists on the backs of engelopes and lamenting
                  the impossibility of sharing playwrights like Raimund, Nestroy
                  and Grillparzer and novelists like Adalbert Stifter with the
                  English-speaking world. Auden knew quite well, of course, that
                  it is not so much the language barrier, as a fatal lack of
                  universality which has made so many leading Austrian writers - as
                  used to be said of Austrian wine though with less justification
                  travel so badly. In a foreword to a book I
                  wrote on Austria Auden was to write:
                  "The relation between Art and Society is so obscure that only
                  a fool will claim that he understands it. How, as the author
                  asks in her concluding chapter on Vienna, is one to explain the
                  extraordinary eruption of genius in that city which began during
                  the last decades of the nineteenth century and lasted until the
                  late 1920s, manifesting itself in every field, literature, music,
                  painting, philosophy, medicine? When it began the empire was
                  already dying on its feet, and it continued after its total
                  collapse. Why? Even more extraordinary in my opinion were the
                  artistic achievements of men like Nestroy and Adalbert Stifter
                  living in Metternich's police state. More than that, I cannot
                  help wondering if they could have written what they did under a
                  more liberal regime. Talking of Stifter, (the author) says
                  that he, like the composer Bruckner, 'has not travelled well'.
                  Of Bruckner this may be true, but of Stifter I would say that he
                  has not travelled, period: until a few years ago nobody had
                  attempted to translate him."

                  Perhaps it is worth reminding ourselves of the abortive
                  scheme in these difficult times, because of the underlying
                  principle: that leaeing writers of the day, who can no doubt
                  earn good money in other ways, should be given some form of
                  enducement to translate from foreign languages at a standard
                  equivalent to the original. And also, to recall that Auden
                  ot gra Cra tere
                  On the whole, it is arguable
                  himself was a major translator/.
                  that English literature has been better served by its German
                  translators than vice versa., the excellence
                  of Rudolf Alexander Schröder's version of Eliot's „Murder in
                  the Cathedral“ comes to mind: a major writer himself, Schröder
                  produced a rendering in which all the cadences, the true Eliot
                  „sound“ are there, so that it is almost a matter of indifference
                  whether the play is read in English or German. And in a way,
                  Eliot hardly deserved it: Not long ago George Steiner referred
                  to English writers' lack of ya sympathy towards the German
                  classics and mentioned Auden as a striking exception.
                  § Leaving Shakespeare on one side, as no modern translators have
                  managed to banish the Schlegel-Tieck version from the stage,
                  Eva Hesse made her name with Ezra Dound's
                  Cantos, a masterpiece of the translator's art.
                  Auden immensely enjoyed working on Goethe's "Italian
                  Journey", and was always delighted when he came upon errors in
                  the original caused by Goethe's own faulty editing. Goethe as
                  a man fascinated him - three items in "Forewords and Afterwords"
                  and much else of an earlier date are there to prove it. So it
                  can't have been later than 1962 when there was a ring at the
                  doorbell of my flat in Vienna. I opened the door and there was
                  Auden, panting, as well he might because this was before our
                  lift was put in and he had climbed ninety steps from street
                  level. His shirt was grubby, his tie askew, his hair was
                  matted, and before he was half through the door and with no
                  further greeting he gasped out:
                  "I have come to the conclusion that Goethe was a very
                  lonely man."

                  Which I think we may doubt. But Auden knew loneliness.
                  Gate-crashing ghost, aggressive
                  invisible visitor,
                  tactless gooseberry, spoiling
                  my tete-å-tète with myself,
                  blackmailing brute, behaving
                  as if the house were your own..
                  The strength, the violence of the pictures in this poem can
                  hardly be paralleled in any other on a related subject.
                  Loneliness is a vicious being, which makes the mind a quagmire
                  of disquiet. A shadow without shape or sex, excluding
                  consolation, blotting out Nature's beauties, it is a grey
                  mist between the self and God. What helps? Routine; typing
                  business letters. But Auden is safe from its haunting only
                  when fast asleep. Yet: tomorrow
                  Chester, my chum, will return.
                  Then you'll be through: in no time
                  he'll throw you out neck-and-crop,
                  We'll merry-make your cadence
                  with music, feasting and fun.
                  When Auden walked into Neulinggasse 26 and said what
                  he did about Goethe, it would be almost nine years before he
                  would write this poem, but he was already facing what may have
                  seemed the disaster of Chester's decision mot to return to
                  New York.
                  In October 1964 he went to a PEN conference in Budapest,
                  and came back saying that he had heard an unbelievable amount
                  of hot air. The French delegates had got on his nerves with
                  much talk about "mon åme." He may have been unjust: Auden
                  
                  was not a lover of the French language, saying that
                  and log
                  it is quite wrong to call it the most precise or rängüages;
                  in no other can a person deliver himself of so much intellectual
                  jibberish. But I had the courage to
                  remind him that Paul Tillich had said he had learned to think
                  by having to express himself in English and to teach orientals
                  in that language. When he read what he had written years before
                  in German he could barely understand it.

                  14.
                  By the end of October 1964 Auden was in Berlin,
                  where he would spend the winter as a guest of the Ford
                  Foundation. As a visiting professor he would give lectures
                  and be at the disposal of students who wanted to consult him.
                  On 21st November he was arrested for drunk driving. It must have
                  been rather a dreary Christmas, and he remarked in a letter
                  that he was lonely, as who wouldn't be in the circumstances.
                  Berlin-Dahlem, 23rd December, 1964:
                  It was sweet of you to think of me at Christmas, especially
                  since it's a little einsam here. Am beginning to know some
                  local inhabitants. Oddly enough, the ones I can talk to most
                  easily are from Ost-Berlin. The most awful thing about the
                  Bifkes(sic)§ is that they are so much nicer under a little
                  Druck resre. When they feel their oats they are so apt
                  to become uppish." K 1/62T 1Wa
                  Characteristic though it is, one might not feel justified
                  in quoting from this letter if it were not for the fact that
                  it goes on to throw light on a passage in his long poem to
                  Josef Weinheber. It came about like this: I had been reading
                  a paperback called "The Rise of the South African Reich“ by Brian
                  Bunting and mentioned it in my letter with particular reference
                  to torture. And I had complained that certain attitudes found
                  in so-called liberal circles tended to push one further to the
                  right than one wished to go. After a sharp comment on the
                  American magazine "The National Review“ he continues: "Of
                  course you're right aboutthe lib-labs' ostrich attitude to
                  those who wish to destroy them, but one cannot let ones name be

                  bewilders me. I know something about the evil in my own heart

                  from? What class? Whom do they marry?" The words "Have you

                  By 20th March 1965 he had completed, typed out and sent
                  off to me the long poem to Weinheber, with the verse:

                  This was the private Auden. The publie Auden in the interview
                  with "Die Zeit“ quoted earlier, hotly denied that he had been
                  lonely. Many of his predecessors, said the interviewer, had
                  repeatedly complained that little notice had been taken of
                  them and that their stay was far from enjoyable. Auden's
                  reply was „brusque“: Grumbles of that sort were, he thought,
                  unfair and personally objectionable. „One always has to do
                  something to establish contacts, no one can do that for one.
                  Not even the wealthy Ford Foundation or the Berlin senate.
                  It was very ungrateful to accept a monthly grant of a couple
                  of thousand marks and then to start criticising, instead of
                  being thankful to be free to work without financial worries
                  how often was this possible? He himself, he went on, was
                  extraordinarily glad that in Berlin, if that was what a person
                  wanted, he was left in peace: he was used to this'live and

                  Later on, I told Chester about this infinitesimal and
                  unwitting contribution of mine to English literature. Chester
                  snapped: "Wystan never wastes anything.
                  There exists a prose translation of the poem to Weinheber,
                  made by Auden and „a German friend“, which he sent to me for
                  checking together with some amendments to stanza three. As the
                  occasion for which the poem was written was a celebration of
                  the 20th anniversafy of Weinheber's death, the prose translation
                  was for general information.
                  "Herewith my effort“ Auden wrote, „do do my Gemeindepflicht.
                  (his civic duty.)
                  It hardly needs saying that Auden's interest in Weinheber
                  want far beyond a mere civic duty. It was part of his whole
                  relationship with Lower Austria, his feeling for the landscape,
                  for its history, for the history of the people who lived, or
                  had lived there. For some reason he felt at home there, and
                  the truth of this is to be found in the best known poems of his
                  last decade - perhaps they are among the best he ever wrote.
                  There is the first part of The Cave of Making (In Memoriam Louis
                  MacNeice.) ne often emphasizes how unsensational it all is:
                  "In a house backed by orderly woods,
                  Facing a tractored sugar-beet country,
                  Your working hosts engaged to their stint,

                  Teckla Clark).
                  It strikes me suddenly as odd that he should have said that:

                  I'm glad the builder gave
                  our common-room small windows
                  through which no observed outside can observe us: rr
                  Quite untrue. If they had the light on anyone approaching the
                  door could and did see them. In the poem to Weinheber he
                  tells him: „Here, though, I feel as at home as you did“.
                  But the most moving declaration af loxe is in Prologue at
                  Sixty (for Friedrich Heer).
                  It satisfied him to live neit door to where the poet
                  Josef Weinheber had lived, a man for whom he felt a remarkable
                  empathy and a strange compassion. It has occurred to me that
                  an element in this sense of identity might have been this:
                  that he himself had once changed his mind. He, like Weinheber,
                  had made a political error and had entirely turned away from it.
                  Weinheber had allowed himself to be wooed by the Nazis, but
                  later on he rejected it all and finally he committed suicide.
                  This may be fanciful; it is put forward simply as a suggestion.
                  Auden knew that he would have got on with the man next door.

                  the Natural History Museum on the Ring.
                  It was very
                  well attended, largely by crowds of note-taking students of
                  Eng. Lit, and I have never been quite sure whether, at one moment,
                  he was treating us to a bit of traditional stage business. He
                  told us that there is a game: if, like the Trinity, we were
                  made up of three persons, what would they be? Eliot, now,
                  contained, firstly, the American pre-Jarkson aristocrat of a
                  kind which died out in 1829. He was a dandy, very carefully

                  dressed in black jacket, striped trousers and bowler hat. And
                  he worked two floors underground. Then there was the little
                  boy aged twenve, adoring practical jokes such as cushions which
                  fart when you sit on them, and who liked to shock people by
                  saying "Goethe is awful“ and so on. Finally, there was the
                  Yiddish Momma...
                  At this point a cascade of papers fell off the high reading
                  desk. Auden disappeared altogether from our sight, scuffed
                  about on the floor for a bit and finally emerged, very slowly,
                  to complete his sentence: "... who wrote the poems". By now
                  a very few people were shaking with silent laughter, but the
                  students, with poised biros, blank-faced and puzzled, were
                  waiting for all this to stop.
                  He was understandably proud of having been asked to preach
                  in Westminster Abbey. His triumphant comment to me was:
                  "Eliot never did that“.
                  Spril 1967 brought a literary congress on avantgarde
                  literature to the Palais Palffy on the Josefsplatz in Vienna.
                  Auden came, together with a rich, at moments over-rich collection
                  of dons, writers and critics from eastern and western Europe.
                  A number of journalists and a few public figures were present
                  by invitation, but no intervention from the floor was allowed
                  and seldom desired by the listeners. It was enough to hear
                  Francis Bondy and Mary McCarthy, to enjoy the striking contrast
                  between Yefrim Etkind of Leningrad now at the University of Paris),
                  and the square-headed commissar type from Moscow. And if some
                  of the read contributions were dry, lifeless and badly delivered,
                  we only had to wait for the knockout blow from Marcel Reich-Ranicki.
                  On the whole it was this leading West German critic with his
                  maddeningly declamatory style and wagging index finger
                  who dominated the platform, but it was Etkind who with his quiet,
                  reasonable argument and his good manners won the affection of
                  everyone in the room. x A face-the-public session in the
                  Redoutensaal on the other side of the Josefsplatz ended the
                  congress. I asked Auden whether there was anything I could do fxx
                  to help such as lending him my flat, and he promptly replied:
                  "Yes, help me to look after Philip and Mary.“ We agreed that
                  we would all meet for supper in the Neulinggasse after the public

                  Since I have no pretensions to being a literary hostess,
                  I found the proppect alarming. It was not that, as a journalist,
                  famous men worried me in the least, but famous women are somehow
                  a different matter and I was inclined to be overawed by Mary
                  MacCarthy. But Chester was reassuring. „Don't you worry about
                  Mary, she won't eat you. In fact she'll be charming, she'll
                  merely put you in her next book."
                  A hostess should be at home to welcome her guests, or at
                  the very least, she should arrive with them. I did neither.
                  Having allowed myself to be pushed down to towards the front
                  of the hall, I was trapped and unable to get out, whereas the
                  members of the congress left the platform and were free. M I
                  at last fought my way out and the search began for Yefrim xEkkind
                  whom I had invited as an eastern foil for the westerners) He
                  was run to ground in a back passage, surrounded by fans. It was
                  only with the help of the Viennax Fire Brigade who were clearing
                  the building that I was at last able to extract him from the
                  admiring group and take him out to my car. Knowing that the
                  rest of the party would be standing outside a locked doork I
                  drove fast. Etkind settled himself comfortably, stretched out
                  his legs for a better purchase and said affably: „One day you
                  must come to Leningrad, you'd love to drive there - large, wide,
                  empty streets.“ Since then I have dreamed, Toad-like, of tearing
                  down the almost deserted Nevsky Prospect, but in the meantime
                  Etkind, about whom Auden worried greatly as time went on, mainly
                  on account of his friendship with Sächarow, has left Russia
                  and is living and working in France. And sõhthe all were, a
                  not too friendly row of faces gazing over the banisters
                  on the second floor as we puffed our way upstairs: Auden,
                  nallman, Mary MacCarthy, the Toynbees, the author and critic
                  Hilde Spiel and a Danish journalist friend. But over drink and
                  food the party soon cheered up, and Mary sighed: "What heaven
                  it is to get away from that man Reich-Ranicki!" There was a
                  chorus of assent.
                  In August 1966 The Bassarids had had its premiere at the
                  Salzburg Festival. Now, in the following year, Auden was invited
                  The Bassarids, Opera Seria with Intermezzo in One Act bassed on

                  to deliver the opening address - a highly festive occasion, and
                  his speech would be widely reported. By late April he had already
                  made a draft, and he asked me for my comments. He had, he said,
                  built in a good deal of criticism, but could he get away with it?
                  Was the package sufficiently decorative? After a quick read
                  through I looked up and caught Auden's enquiring eye. What on
                  No amount of packaging could disguise the
                  earth could I say?
                  fact that this was tton the policy behind the Salzburg
                  Festival and its administration; it appeared to be wholly negative
                  Was
                  and the estimated length of half an hour probably too long.
                  Towards the end, where he should be riding high in an appeal for
                  devotion to optimal standards in music and the arts in general
                  and opera in particular, he was grumbling about the
                  erratic workings of the curtain in the Festspielhaus and the lack
                  of canteen facilities for the sceneshifters. It was a horrible
                  anticlimax. Inx s in such a way as to
                  get results without offending him? And there was another thing:
                  he should be advised to rehearse. Auden understood all the nuances
                  of the German language, but his spoken German was not as good as
                  he seemed to think,  and his delivery was apt to become
                  almost incomprehensible.
                  The postmark New York usually meant an announcement of
                  domestic disaster and a request for help, and the winter of 1967
                  brought serious disruption to the peaceful running of the house
                  at Kirchstetten. Auden's poem to Emma Eiermann begins in German:
                  Liebe Frau Emma, / na, was hast du denn gemacht?
                  and it contains just about all there is to say about her, and her
                  relationship witht Auden and Kallman. Tow, the poet
                  ai
                  Saks, cöuld she go and die when they were both away - and what
                  about the cats - they had to be destroyed. but when his letter
                  to me arrived he didn't yet know that: it contains an urgent
                  plea to hurry over to Kirchstetten and find out what on earth
                  was happening to the animals. He couldn't bear to think - it was
                  late November - that they were prowling around, unfed and shut out
                  of her cottage. Later on he weemed to be rather upset that no one
                  came forward to adopt one or two of the cats; the others were

                  strays.
                  In February 1968 he flew over to Vienna to interview 
                  Frau Strobl after the death of Emma Eiermann. We were lunching
                  together at the Opern-Cafe and this was one of the very few
                  occasions when I kept a note of what had been said. Auden had
                  frequently taken a stand against drug-taking, and had made his
                  attitude clear in a number of lectures and interviews. In
                  October 1967, for instance, he brought up the subject in a lecture
                  at Eliot College, and now I told him I was glad he had been
                  saying to young people in England that LSD is a dead duch for
                  creative workers. This led to a long account of the experiments
                  with LSD and Mescalin that he himself had carried out in the
                  company of his doctor. He was perfectly certain that no original
                  line of poetry and no work of art had ever been created under the
                  influence of drugs, and he was convinced that Aldoug Huxley did
                  a lot of harm by publishing his experiences with mescalin, and
                  making people believe it to be an artistic experience. The point
                  is, he said, that young people need to discover who and what they
                  are. And LSD doesn't tell them, it is a purely passive effect in
                  which there is alienation from self. You concentrate on things -
                  a chair, the ceiling etc., - and people become unimportant. There
                  is a curious effect in listening to music: it is intolerable as
                  the sounds lose their interrelation and form. Basically, what you
                  achieve is a mild degree of schizophrenia. After the experiment
                  was over, he and the doctor went round to the local pub. Suddenly,
                  through a window he waw a postman waving at him, and thought my
                  God, this is it. Later on, the postman said "I waved at you,
                  why didn't you answer?“ An interview he gave to the Sunday Telegraph,
                  published on October 29, 1967,adds to what he said in the Opern-Cafe.
                  Much of it is vintage Auden: (tunde he hlag bee i ore denpo aud dn be

                  'Now, I live a lot of the time in New York. You can live really
                  quietly there, you know' says Auden, and anyway Britain he finds on

                  more vulgar. It must be the first time in history that culture has

                  to what the mass does first. And London is so provincial. Paris
                  is provincial. Berlin is provincial. But New York - it's dirty
                  and a damned dangerous place to live in sometimes, but at least it
                  isn't provincial.'... About drug-taking activities in some
                  British universities, Auden says firmly he is an anti-drug man,
                  'although I have taken them myself by way of experiment. By
                  saying that, A don't want Mr. Quintin Hogg down on my neck for
                  corrupting the young or anything. so what I want to make
                  absolutely clear are the three points which should help put young
                  people right off the idea of taking drugs at all.
                  'First, LSD is a dangerous thing - it should be taken only
                  under medical supervision, with somebody there, because you may
                  get the willies and end up in a loony bin. Second, if people
                  think they're going to get any fulfilment in Art through
                  taking drugs then they're in for a hell of a disappointment.
                  Because on tape recordings of people under LSD it's been shown
                  they speak absolute drivel.
                  'Thirdly, and lastly, taking drugs as a short cut to God
                  is absolute drivel as well.'
                  It is true,dentaly, that the progressive "vulgarisation“
                  of London struck him like a blow in the face every time he went
                  there. He seldom failed to mention the subjert when he
                  came back to Kirchstetten, and was particularly angry about the
                  advertisements on the London Underground, which he said beat anything
                  to be found anytwhere.
                  
                  Auden liked to be amused. As I mentioned earlier, he was
                  Interested, as a human phenomenon, in my mother-in-law who
                  until she was forced to abandon it was certainly one of the
                  worst and most dangerous drivers who ever drove the roads of
                  Austria. She never went very fast but she had no idea where
                  the car began and ended nor by what means it was propelled,
                  and she drove her car as though it were a tank, ignoring all
                  that laig in her path. I have seen her move off, the engine
                  howling, in a series of leaps; she had clearly forgotten to
                  release the hand-brake. Her accidents were frequent, and
                  often bizarre, and for all this her basic attitude to traffic
                  was usually to blame. This attitude she made clear once and
                  for all when sitting beside the driver - my brother-in-law - on
                  the road to St. Pölten, which was her, and for that matter
                  Auden s shopping town. They came to a T crossing. It is a
                  blind corner, one is about to turn on to a main arterial road
                  down which the traffic thunders. The law and common sense
                  require one to stop dead, look both ways, and only then to
                  swing across into a gap in the stream of traffic. The driver

                  did precisely this, whereupon my mother-in-law favoured
                  him with a withering glance and said, unforgivably: 'COWARD!'
                  This was Auden's favourite story. She caught him once when
                  he had nipped round to the garagente a look at the
                  state of her Volkswagen after one of the usual smashes. It
                  may have been the time she left the road and charged through
                  one of those telegraph poles with two legs in the shape of
                  an inverted Y, or another time when she failed to take a
                  bend in the road and ended up with one wheel suspended
                  over a vertifal drop into the River Pielach far below. At
                  all events there was a long and painful silence - Mama was
                  famous for her silences - which Auden found it difficult to
                  break. Whenever I saw him again for the first time after
                  his arrival in the spring, sooner or later a look of gleeful
                  expectancy would usher in the question: "Now: tell me about
                  ma-in-law's latest car smash.'
                  The reason why Auden himsalf failed one day to take a
                  corner in Kirchstetten village and crashed I never had the

                  The following conversation enaued:
                  "May I ask whether Professor Auden is still in hospital,
                  presumably in the scaudenm casualty department, or whether he
                  has been sent home?"
                  "Professor who?

                  his right arm and shoulder in plster.
                  offhand about the accident, but his memories of the hospital
                  which he had just left by tawi were unimpaired. They hadn't
                  exactly put out the red carpet. For a long time, the first and
                  only attention he had received was from man who wantedx
                  name and address and all relevant det ils and, above all, "how
                  I proposed to pay for the treatment."
                  Soon I was asking what I could do for him and in what order.
                  What was the most urgent thing?
                  "I'm almost out of gin“. Perhaps I would be kind enough
                  to ring up Wild, the grocers on the Neuer Markt in Vienna, and
                  ask them to send some down. But why, I asked, couldn't I
                  drive to Böheimkirchen right away and fetch some? They'd have
                  the usual brands. No, call up Wild.
                  Back in the Neulinggasse I rang up that high quality
                  emporium and gave the order. „Are you" it seemed sensible to
                  ask, "delivering in that district during the nert few days?"
                  We rax virtually never deliver to the country, Madam,
                  but we always make a special trip for the Herr Professor.
                  "Cie After a shocked
                  silence I said: „It's no business of mine, but tht's a pretty
                  pricey way of buying the same make of gin as he could get at
                  the local grocer's.
                  "Quite right, Madum, „said the cheerful voise. „But that
                  has been the Herr Professor's usuel practice for some years.y

                  about Austrian politics or antthing else that came to mind
                  to cheer him over the interval until Chester arrived, from
                  Athens. He had been back to the hospital for a check up on
                  the sit of the plaster, and heur as I walked in he grinned
                  from ear to ear: „What did vou say to them? I was treated
                  like royalty." For the record, the hospital did in fact
                  write a handsome apology in reply to my letter.
                  Auden would often lend his car to someone or other during
                  the winter, and one day when he and Chester turned up to lunch
                  at Fridau I was shown, with some amusement, a bullet hole in
                  the car - just o below the windscreen, in line with the
                  driver's seat. Having had a little experience of some of
                  Chester's friends in Vienna 1 wasn't altogether surprised,x
                  
                  mC
                  but it later transpired that I was wrong. Naturally, no one had
                  told me of the existence of Auden's callboy Hugie, and it was
                  he who, having been lent the car, was involved in events which
                  led to his arrest and imprisonment. In the end, the car became a
                  total wreck, and the circumstances are the subject of various
                  increasingly frantic letters from Auden before and after
                  Christmas 1968. In December, Chester's Greek friend Jean Boras
                  who often stayed with the two men in Kirchstetten, was in Vienna
                  and using the car. One day, on the road between Vienna and
                  Kirchstetten he collided with a lorry head on and was killed
                  instantly.
                  I was away at the time and omyy got back to the
                  Neulinggasse shortly before Christmas, to find a letter from Auden
                  telling me what had happened. Chester had been so prostrated with
                  grief that he, Auden, had hardly been able to understand him on
                  In
                  in
                  the telephone from Athens, but he believed that he must be in
                  Vienna. Would I look for him and see what I could do?
                  The
                  (vate
                  thought of Chester's frame of mind, alone in Vienna over
                  Christmas, was blood-chilling, and my imagination ran away with me.
                  A protracted search produced no signs that he had been in Austria
                  at all, and it finally turned out that he had never left Athens.
                  Letters flew to and fro on the subjects of: release of corpse,
                  release of wrecked car and/or papers, with Auden becoming
                  increasiggly impatient ("I am in despair“) over the inaction both
                  of officialdom and of his lawyers. He was learning the hard way

                  that to attempt to carry out any form of business in Vienna
                  between the last days
                  before Christmas and the Feast of the Epiphany on January 6th
                  is a sheer wagte of time; during the Twelve Days of Christmas
                  not even a partridge in a peartree moveß.
                  When Auden and Kallman got back to Austria in April
                  Chester was still profoundly shaken up and I remember Auden's
                  anxiety, saying to me “I don't know how he's going to get
                  through the summer.“ And it struck me: what a contrast between
                  these two writers: the lesser poet but much younger man,
                  cooking too much rich food for the entirely sedentary life
                  that they both led, but otherwise with little purpose left.yy
                  And the far greater and much older poet, with his regular
                  hours of work and his considerable putput. The days of their
                  very fruitful collaboration on opera libretti were already
                  over; what remained was the Times crossword.
                  It was so easy, I think, to make fun of the slightly
                  old-maidish ways of the house. In all those amusing and
                  sssentially true articles in newspapers and glossy
                  magazines the tendency is to leage out this all-important fact:
                  Auden was a very hard-working, systematic, self-disciplined
                  writers, who knew, none better, how nice it is to sit sipping
                  a cool drink in the shade of a tree, whiling away the hours,
                  looking with contentment upon his flowers and his asparagus beds.
                  This he did, but having worked steadily through from 9 o'clock
                  until lunchtime. And much of the bosky contentment, the cool
                  drinks and so on, were simply owing to the presence of guests,
                  including the journalist with his sharp eye. So that these
                  sometimes rather rib-nudging descriptions of this unconventional
                  household leave it altogether to us to remember that in the
                  last dozen years of his life, Auden was writing several volumes
                  of poetry, opera libretti, translating the Eluer Edda, the
                  "Italian Journey ", Dag Hammarskjöld's „Markings“ and other
                  works, editing "The Dyer's Hand“, the "Faber Book of Aphorisms",
                  his Commonplace book, "Forewords and Afterwords", and that
                  heavenly compilation the „Nineteenth Century Book of Minor Poets“.
                  He was reading over an enormous field, writing and delivering
                  leztures, writing articles and book reviews - sometimes they
                  were demanding publications such as Emily Anderson's 3 volume

                  "Letters of Beethoven" - which he gave me, the blank pages are
                  filled with his notes - and even a new 12 volume annotated
                  translation of the Bible. In any case, the sacred beast in his
                  lair was probably much wittier than most strangers who came
                  to view the set-up.
                  On 19th May 1970 I was mildly horrified (I write in German
                  but do not translate into it) to get a telegram asking "If I
                  sent half hour speech in a few days could you translate soon
                  into German - Love Wystan." On the principle: say yes now,
                  worry afterwards, I agreed. He was to deliver the speech a couple
                  of weeks later in small country town of Neulengbach in the
                  presence of the governor of Lower Austria. After making a draft,
                  I sent both texts to my husband so that he could polish up my
                  version.  It had not been easy.
                  Sehr verehrter Herr Landeshauptmann, meine Damen und Herren:
                  I hope you will pardon me if I speak somewhat personally.
                  I do so, not out of vanity, but because + do not wish to give the
                  impression that I am attempting to lay down absolute laws which
                  are valid for all. I give you my experiences as a poet, in the hope
                  that you will be able to compare them with yours, and form your
                  own judgment about them.
                  Most of what I know about the writing of poetry, or at least
                  about the kind I am interested in writing, I discovered long
                  before I took any interest in poetry itsel".
                  Between the ages of six and twelve, P spent a great many
                  of my waking hours in the fabrication of a private secondary
                  sacred world, the basic elements of which were f a) a limestone
                  landscape mainly derived from the Pennine Moors in the North of
                  England and b) an industry - lead-mining.
                  It is no doubt psychologically significant that my sacred
                  world was autistic - that is to say, I had no wish to share it
                  with others nor could I have done so. However, though constructed
                  for and inhabited by myself alone, I needed the help of others,
                  my parents in particular, in collecting its basic materials;
                  others had to procure for me the necessary text-books on geology
                  and machinery, maps, catalogues, guide-books and photographs,
                  and, when occasion offered, to take me down real mines, tasks

                  which they performed with unfailing patience and generosity.
                  From this activity, I learned certain principles which I was
                  later to find applied to all artistic fabrication. First, whatever
                  other elements it may include, the initial impulse to create a
                  secondary world is a feeling of awe aroused by encounters, in the
                  Primary World, with sacred beings or events. This feeling of awe
                  is an imperative, that is to say, one is not free to choose the
                  object or the event that arouses it. Though every work of art
                  is a secondary world, it cannot be constructed ex nihilo, but is
                  a selection from and a recombination of the contents of the
                  Primary World. Even the 'purest' poem, in the French Symboliste
                  sense, is made of words which are not che poet's private property,
                  but the communal creation of the linguistic group to whom he
                  belongs, so that their meaning can be looked up in a dictionary.
                  Secondly, in constructing my private world, I discovered
                  that, though this was a game, or rather precisely because it was a
                  game - that is to say, not a necessity like eating or sleeping,
                  but something I was free to do or not as a chose - it could not
                  be played without rules. Absolute freedom is meaningless:
                  freedom can only be realised in a choice between alternatives.
                  A secondary world, be it a poem, or a game of football or bridge,
                  must be as much a world of law as the Primary, the only difference
                  being that in the world of games one is free to decide what its
                  laws shall be. But to all games as to real life, Goethe's lines
                  apply.
                  In der Beschränkung zeigt sich erst der Meister¬
                  Und das Gesets nur kand uns Breiheit geben.
                  As regards my particular lead-mining world, I decided, or
                  rather, without conscious decision I instinctively felt, that I
                  must impose two restrictions upon my freedom of fantasy. In
                  choosing what objects were to be included, I was free to select
                  this and reject that, on condition that both were real objects
                  in the Primary World, to choose, for example, between two kinds of
                  water-turbine, which could be found in a text-book on mining
                  machinery or a manufactumr's catalogue: but I was not free to
                  invent one. In deciding how my world was to function, I could
                  choose between two practical possibilities - a mine can be drained

                  weither by an adit or a pump - but physical impossibilities and
                  magic means were forbidden. When I say forbidden, I mean that I
                  felt, in some obscure way, that they were morally forbidden.
                  Then there came a day when the moral issue became quite conscious.
                  As I was planning my Platonic Idea of a concentrating-mill, I
                  ran into difficulties. I had to choose between two types of a
                  certain machine for separating the slimes, called a buddle.
                  One type I found more sacred or 'beautiful', but the other type
                  was, I knew from my reading, the more efficient. At this point
                  I realised that it was my moral duty to sacrifice my aesthetic
                  preference to reality or truth.
                  When, later, I began to write poetry, I found that, for me
                  at least, the same obligation was binding. That is to say, I
                  cannot accept the doctrine that, in poetry, there is a 'suspension
                  of belief'. A poet must never make a statement simply because
                  it sounds poetically exciting: he must also believe it to be true.
                  ihis does not mean, of course, that one can only appreciate a
                  poet whose beliefs happen to co-incide with ones own. It does
                  mean, however, that one must be convinced that the poet really
                  believes what he says, however odd the belief may seem to oneself.
                  Between constructing a private fantasy world for oneself alone
                  and writing poetry, there is, of course, a profound difference.
                  A fantasy world exists only in the head of its creator: a poem
                  is a public verbal object intended to be read and enjoyed by others.
                  lo become conscious of others is to become conscious of historical
                  time.in various ways. The contents of a poem are necessarily
                  past experiences, and the goal of a poem is necessarily in the
                  future, since it cannot be read until it has beenxx written.
                  Again, to write a poem is to engage in an activity which human
                  beings have practised for centuries. If one asks why human beings
                  make poems or paint pictures or compose music, I can see two
                  possible answers. Firstly all the artistic media are forms of
                  an activity peculiar to human beings, namely, Personal Speech.
                  Many animals have impersonal codes of communications, visual,
                  olfactory, auditory signals, hy which they convey to other members

                  of their species vital information about food, territory, sex,
                  the presence of enemies etc., and in social animals like the bee,
                  such a code may be exceedingly complex. We, too, of course, often
                  use words in the same way, as when I ask a stranger the way to the
                  railroad station. But when we truly speak, we do something quite
                  different. We speak as person to person in order to disclose
                  ourselves to others and share our experiences with them, not
                  because we must, but because we enjoy doing so. This activity
                  is sometimes quite erroneously called 'self expression'. If I
                  write a poem about experiences I have had, I do so because I think
                  it should be of interest and value to others: the fact that it has
                  till now only been my experience is accidental. What the poet or
                  any artist has to convey is a perception of a reality common to
                  all, but seen from a unique perspective, which it is his duty as
                  well as his pleasure to share with others. To small truths as
                  well as great, St. Augustine's words apply.
                  The truth is neither mine nor his nor another's; but belongs
                  to usall whom Theu callest to martake ofit wärning us
                  terribly not to aecountit private to oufgelves. Iest
                  webe dehrived or 1t.
                  Then the second impulse to artistic fabrication is the desire to
                  transcend our mortality, by making objects which, unlike ourselves,
                  are not subject to natural death, but can remain permanently
                  'on hand' in the world, long after we and our society have perished.
                  Every genuine work of art, I believe, exhibits two qualities,
                  Nowness and Permanence. By Nowness I mean the quality which enables
                  an art-historian to date a work, at least, approximately. If,
                  for example, one listens to a composition by Palestrina and one by
                  Mozart, one knows immediately that, quite aside from their artistic
                  merits, Palestrina must have lived earlier than Mozart: he could
                  not possibly have written as he did after Mozart. By Permanence,
                  I mean that the work continues to have relevance and importance
                  long after its creator is dead. In the history of Art, unlike the
                  history of Science, no genuine work of art is made obsolete by a
                  later work. Past science is of interest only to the historian of
                  science, not to what scientists are doing at this moment. Past

                  works of art, on the other hand, are of the utmost importance
                  to the contemporary practitioner. Every artist tries to produce
                  something now, but in the hope that, in time, it will take its
                  proper place in the tradition of his art. And he cannot produce
                  anything significantly original unless he knows well what has
                  already been done; that is to say, he cannot 'rebel' against the
                  past without having a profound reverence for it.
                  There are periods in history when the arts develop uninterr-
                  uptedly, each generation building on the achievements of the
                  previous generation. There are other periods when radical breaks
                  seem to be necessary. However, when they are, one will generally
                  find that the 'radical' artist does not disown the past, but finds
                  in works of a much earlier period or in those of a culture (other)
                  than his own, the clue as to what he should do now. In my own
                  case, for example, I know how much I owe to Anglo-Saxon and
                  Medieval Poetry.
                  When I review the contemporary artistic scene, it strikes me
                  how extraordinarily fortunate men like Stravinsky, Picasso, Eliot,
                  etc., that is, those persons we think of as the founders of
                  'modern' art, were in being born when they were, so that they came
                  to manhood before 1914. Until the First World War, western
                  society was still pretty much what it had been in the nineteenth
                  century. This meant that for these artists, the felt need to
                  create something new arose from an artistic imperative, not a
                  historic imperative. No one asked himself: „What is the proper
                  kind of music to compose or picture to paint or poem to write
                  in the year 1912?" Secondly, their contemporary audiences
                  were mostly conservative, but honestly so. Those, for instance,
                  who were scandalised by Le Sacre du Printemps, may seem to us now
                  to have been old fogies, but their reaction was genuine. They did
                  not say to themselves: "Times have changed and we must change
                  with them in order not to be left behind."
                  nere are a few statements by Stravinsky to which the young,
                  whether artists or critics would do well to listen and ponder over.

                  In times, like our own, of rapid social change and political
                  crisis, there is always a danger of confusing the principles
                  governing political action and those governing artistic fabrication
                  The most important of such confusions are three.
                  Firstly, one may come to think of artistic fabrication as a
                  form of political action. Every citizen, poets included, has a
                  duty to be politically 'engage', that is, to play a responsible
                  part in seeing that the society of which he is a member shall
                  funstion properly and improve. But the poet, qua poet, has only
                  one political function. Since language is his medium, it is his
                  duty, by his own example, to defend his mother-tongue against
                  corruption by demagogues, journalists, the mass-media etc. As
                  Karl Kraus said: „Die Sprache ist die Mutter, nicht das Magd,
                  des Gedankens.", and when language loses its meaning,
                  its place is taken by violence. Of course, the poet may use
                  political and social events as subject-matter for poems - they
                  are as much a part of human experience as love or nature - but
                  he must never imagine that his poems have the power to affect
                  the course of history. The political and social history of
                  Europe would be what it has been if Dante, Shakespeare, Goethe,
                  Michael Angelo, Titian, Mozart, Beethoven, etc. had never existed
                  Where political and social evils are concerned, only two
                  things are effective: political action and straightforward,
                  truthful, detailed journalistic rapportage of the facts. The Arts
                  are powerless.
                  The second confusion, of which Plato is the most famous exampde,
                  is to take artistic fabrication as the model for a good society.

                  Such a model, if put into practice, is bound to produce a tyranny.
                  The aim of the artist is to produce an object which is complete
                  and will endure without change. In the 'city' of a poem, there
                  are always the same inhabitants doing exactly the same jobs for
                  ever. A society which was really like a good pome, embodying the
                  aesthetic virtues of order, economy and subordination of the
                  detail to the whole, would be a nightmare of horror for, given the
                  historical reality of actual men, such a society could only come
                  into being through selective breeding, extermination of the
                  physically and mentally unfit, absolute obedience to its Director,
                  a large slave class kept out of sight in cellars and the strictest
                  censureship (sic) of the Arts, forbidding anything to be said
                  which is out of keeping with the official 'line'.
                  The third confusion, typical of our western 'free' societies
                  at this time, is the opposite of Plato's, namely to take political
                  action as the model for artistic fabrication. Political action
                  is a necessity, that is to say, at (e)very moment something has
                  to be done, and it is momentary - action at this moment is
                  immediately followed by another action at the next. Artistic
                  fabrication, on the other hand, is voluntary - the alternative
                  to one work of art can be no work of art - and the artistic
                  object is permanent, that is to say, immune to historical change.
                  The attempt to model artistic fabrication on political action can
                  therefore, only reduce it to momentary and arbitrary 'happenings',
                  a conformism with the tyranny of the immediate moment which is
                  far more enslaving and destructive of integrity than any conformism
                  with past tradition.
                  At this point, a little digression on the subject of 'free
                  verse, which seems now to be almost universal among young poets.
                  Though excellent examples, the poems of D.Hr Lawrence, for example,
                  exist, they are, in my opinion, the exception, not the rule.
                  The great virtue of formal metrical rules is that they forbid
                  automatic responses and, by forcing the poet to have second
                  thoughts, free him from the fetters of self. All too often, the
                  result of not having a fixed form to be true to, is a self-
                  indulgence which in the detached reader can only cause boredom.
                  Further, in my experience, contrary to what one might expect, the
                  free-verse poets sound much more like each other than those who
                  write in fixed forms. Whatever freedom may do, it does not, it
                  would seem, x make for originality.

                  What, then, can the Arts do for us. In my opinion, they can
                  do two things. They can, as Dr. Johnson said, 'enable us a little
                  better to enjoy life or a little better to endure it.“ And,
                  because they are objects permanently on hand in the world, they
                  are the chief means by which the living are able to break bread
                  with the dead, and, without a communication with the dead, I do
                  not believe that a fully human civilised life is possible.
                  Perhaps, too, in our age, the mere making of a work of art
                  is itself a political act. So long as artists exist, making
                  what they please or think they ought to make, even if their works
                  are not terribly good, they remind the Management of something
                  managers need to be reminded of, namely, that the managed are
                  people with faces, not anonymous numbers, that Homo Laborans
                  is also Homo Ludens.
                  And now, I hope those of you who know no English will
                  forgive me if I conclude these remarks with a light poem of my
                  own, entitled Doggerel by a Senior Citizen."
                  To what extent parts of this lecture had been said or written
                  before is immaterial, it is still surprising that chose to
                  repeat it in Neulengbach. If here and there, he
                  Adopted what I would disown
                  The preacher's loose immodest tone
                  in the main, such a closely argued statement must surely have
                  floated past the ear of most of his listeners. This would not,
                  think, have been because of an innate lack of intelligence
                  on their part but because the Austrian and the German academic
                  mind tends towards compartmentalised thought more than is the
                  case among well educated Americans, British and French people who
                  may have acquired the ability to survey one discipline in terms
                  of another. This exceedingly demanding speech tells one something
                  else about Auden: he never talked down to people. They would
                  absorb as much as they were able to, as much as they were ready,
                  for; and someone would have understood a great deal. Auden's
                  attitude towards language as a means towards „artistic fabrication“
                  is I think in the exact sense of the word sacramental. Holding
                  the insights that he die into the nature of the poet's struggle
                  with the primary world, it is hardly surprising that he should
                  have held strong views on modern translations of the Bible - a
                  subject he often came back to in conversation - and revised

                  liturgies. The new banality offended his acute sense of the
                  power contained in words and phrases which have brought mankind
                  into mystical contact with the primary world: Darkness, Silence,
                  Nothing, Death, and all those things which are held sacred by any
                  particular cultural group. It is consistent that Auden was
                  suspicious of Eng.Lit. textual analysis; that he felt the importance
                  that - gross mijunderstanding apart - the reader should receive
                  something from a poem; it is consistent that he should have laughed
                  when he told me that some earnesl person wanted to know just what he
                  had meant by a word written thirty years ago. „Ridiculous! How
                  should I know?"
                  It always seemed that as the years passed Auden became more
                  and more English; this natural process of reverting to type annoyed
                  Chester who would expostulate at signs of it. He liked to listen
                  to the cool, rounded tones of the British county gentry, he intensely
                  admired "Akenfield“, he loved the Lucia novels by E.F. Benson, he
                  happily read and reviewed „The History of the British Nannie“ and
                  he was addicted to English detective novels - his collection is now
                  at Fridau. I dropped in one early afternoon on my way to Vienna,
                  just to leave something for him, I forget what. Auden came pounding
                  down the rickety outside staircase, greeted me with his usual warmth,
                  urged me to come in, to stay ... No no, I said, we're both busy,
                  I must get on. "Oh!“ he exclaimed, and it was as though he were
                  begging me not to infringe the most basic rule of British hospitality:
                  "But you can't go without having a cup of tea!"
                  That study of his is so bare now: it is tThe Cave of Making“
                  which he wished he could have shown to Louis MacNeice, and the house
                  and garden.
                  . Devoid of
                  flowers and family photographs, all is subordinate
                  here to a function, designed to
                  discourage daydreams - hence windows averted from plausible
                  videnda but admitting a light one
                  could mend a watch by - and to sharpen hearing: reached
                  by an
                  outside staircase, domestic
                  noises and odours, the vast background of natural
                  life are shut off. Here silence
                  is turned into objects.
                  To write to Auden unnecessarily would have been to encroach on
                  his time. But Chester spent the whole of one winter in Vienna and
                  could hardly resist describing a party in Chester's flat.

                  Afterwards, I had given a lift home to a carload of people
                  including one whose pockets, had 1 but known it, were stuffed
                  with Chester's money - lifted from a jacket hanging on the
                  bedroom door. The party itself had been all but wrecked by a
                  loudly argumentative individual who succeeded in clearing the
                  sittingroom altogether as the guests gradually slunk off to the
                  kitchen, refugees from his abrasive but tedious presenfe.
                  Auden's reply was:
                  "So! You encountered the one-whose-name-we-never-mention.
                  Why Chester should have been so foolish as to invite him to a
                  party I cannot imagine. If he is to be seen at all he is to
                  be seen alone."
                  My next sighting of this cloven-hooved adjunct to the
                  Viennese literary scene was at Auden's funeral, where I watched
                  him work his way up the procession to the church until he found
                  the place he sought: immediately behind the coffin among the
                  chief mourners. Wondering at this, and remembering Wystan's
                  sinister euphemism, I subsequently asked Chester whether Auden
                  had ever liked the man. „LIKED him“shrieked Chester. „Why,
                  he crossed himself whenever his name was mentioned."
                  In that same letter to New Work I mentioned that a friend
                  of his had quoted him as using the term - as a definition of
                  humour - „Serious insistence on unseriousness.“ His response
                  was as follows: "X has a genius for subtle misrepresentation.
                  'Serious insistence on unseriousness' telescopes two distinct
                  donvictions of mine, falsifying both.
                  One. I believe it to be a serious moral error when an artist
                  overestimates the importance of art and, by implication, of
                  himself. One must admit that the political history of Europe,
                  with the same horrors, would be what it has been, if Dante,
                  Shakespeare, Goethe, Titian, Mozart, et al, had never existed.
                  Two. I believe that the only way in which, to-day at any rate,
                  one can speak seriously about serious matters (the alternative
                  is silence) is comically.... I have enormously admired - and
                  been influenced by - the tradition of Jewish humor. More than
                  any other people, surely, they have seen in serious matters,
                  that is to say, human suffering, the contradictions of human
                  existence, and the relation between man and God occasions for
                  humorous expression. e.g. 'If the rich could hire other people
                  to die for them, the poor could make a wonderful living', or,

                  will provide - ah, if only he would till He does so. "After a
                  brief domestic chronicle he adds that a friend of his who teaches
                  schyzophrenics had a seventeen year old girl who was interested
                  in poetry. Asked what poets she liked, she mentioned Auden.
                  I happen to know him quite well'said the friend. To whöch the
                  girl in astonishment: You mean to say, he's still alive?
                  (Auden was about 58 at the time).
                  That deeply scored face which struck awe into so many people
                  who saw him, that battlefield so mercilessly displayed above dozens
                  upon dozens of newspaper articles when I look at my own photographs
                  of him I am appalled at the speed of the development. It was a
                  head straight out of the icelandic sagas, or a prehistoric head
                  from the bogs of Jutland. Auden should have been carted, much
                  larger than life, by Henry Moore and placed in effigy on a high hill.
                  Abruptly, the way most statements emerged from Auden, he said
                  one day at lunch „Kokoschka wants to paint me." It appears that
                  Oskar Kokoschka had written and asked him to come to Switzerland.
                  But Auden felt it was too much of an effort, and evidently the much
                  older man felt the same way, so that nothing came ofit. tisa
                  great pity, because for one thing they would have enjoyed each
                  other's company, and the sight of these physically so oddly similar
                  men sitting together must have fired some onlooker if only to the
                  extent of taking a historic snapshot. Nor does Auden's closing
                  remark on the subject provide much compensation for the lack of the
                  portrait, though the thought satisfied him. „After all", he said,
                  as he reached for his wine glass and narrowed his eyes to slits
                  against the sunlight seeping in from the garden, „After all, I AM
                  a Kokoschka painting.
                  But the causes: the question needs to be answered. Why was
                  Auden, in his sixties and indeed much earlier, a prematurely aged
                  man? „Ein alter Mann", one or two German obituarists were to write,
                  but without surprise, or: "the aged poet“ - when he was 68!
                  Surely not. There is one explanation which I place on record
                  only after much hesitation. Some time after Auden's death Chester
                  Kallman gave me his explanation for the evidence that Wystan had
                  become older than his years warranted: he put the phenomenon down
                  t.o Benzedrine. „For how long?" Oh, said Chester, he began right
                  back in his early years in the States. And he had carried on right
                  through, only dropping the habit when he came to spend his summers

                  in Austria. Most people now have forgotten about Benzedrene;
                  other things have taken its place. Chester reminded me that it
                  was the stimulant with the help of which airmen in wartime,
                  examinees, doctors and so on, could keep themselves going in a
                  state of complete wakefulness, to carry them through a period
                  of temporary stress. Taken for a restricted purpose, perhaps by
                  a surgeon faced with operations round the clock after a major
                  disaster, it was a blessing. Physical reserves would be replaced
                  later when the emergency was over. But to take Benzedrene over a
                  long period meant - I am quoting Kallman and subject to correction
                  using up ones body at an accelerated rate with the obvious
                  consequence that it would become prematurely aged.
                  It would be difficult to think of any reason why Chester should
                  say this if it were not substantially true. As to why Auden
                  should have felt he needed such a powerful stimulant, over and
                  .

                  Perhaps an extract from Edmund Wilson's
                  years can answer.
                  "W.H. Auden in America" is helpful: it is one of a collection of
                  critical essays edited by Monroe Spears and published in 1964:
                  the operative phrase lies buried in the quotation.
                  "Since becoming an American citizen, the poet has not
                  ceased to explore, to roam - he has covered more ground in
                  this country than most Americans do, and he now spends every
                  summer in ltaly. This spring he returns to England to be
                  lecturer on poetry at Oxford. It is a part of his role to go
                  everywhere, x be accessible to all sorts of people, serve
                  interestedly and conscientiously in innumerable varied
                  capacities: on the staff of a Middle Western college; at a
                  cultural congress in India; on a grand jury in New York City,
                  deciding the fate of gangsters; on a committee of the
                  American Academy, making handouts to needy writers. He has
                  above all withstood the ordeal of Emerica through a habitation
                  of seventeen years; he has even 'succeeded' here.“ And he
                  has made all these exploits contribute to the work of a great
                  English poet who is also - in the not mondain sense - one
                  of the great English men of the world."

                  36.
                  During the uprising in Czechoslovakia in the early autumn
                  of 1968 Vienna was filled with people who had come across the
                  border bent on emigration, or simply to snuff the air outside
                  their own country and explore the possibilities. Many people
                  had strangers in their houses and Auden wanted to do his bit.
                  As he was just leaving Kirchstetten he left it to me to choose
                  a suitable family, and having done so I wrote to him c/o Heyworth,
                  32 Bryanston Square, London W.1. A reply is dated 15 October 1968:
                  „Got back from Oxford yesterday and found your letter wait ing.
                  1) I think I ought to take the couple in, but I must leave
                  it to you to decide whether they are O.K. If they are, all
                  rooms, including my study, which can't be heated) are open
                  to them.
                  2) How much money will they need to keep going? And how
                  shall I make the arrangements for payment.
                  3) Will they be able to find work or emigrate before I
                  return in April, when I'M afraid there will not be room
                  for them?
                  4) I'm worried about how they will get gas cylinders for
                  cooking from Neulengbach, since, presumably, they have no car.
                  I expect someone in the village will, help.
                  5) If and when they come, I must know in advance so that
                  I can write a note to the Burgomeister...
                  The couple found somewhere else to live in a less remote
                  place, the emergency was soon over and Auden did not disguise
                  his relief:
                  "77 St. Mark's Place, N.Y.C.
                  Nov. 6th.
                  Many thanks for your letter. Of course, selfishly, I'm
                  rather relieved. How horrid one is!
                  The U.S. is grim."
                  Auden was an extraordinarily generous person. An evening
                  at the Opern Cafe comes to mind. Wystan and Chester had been to
                  a performance over the road and had asked me to join them afterwards
                  It was hoped that Balanchine would join us, but to my disappointment
                  he never turned up. Conversation was lively, and the more so, the

                  greater the contrast with the enforred silence of a young
                  Austrian whose identity was never fully revealed, though
                  Chester muttered to me: „Wystan is helping with his studies
                  at the College of Technology.“ When the party broke up it
                  turned out that the young man lived in my direction, so I took
                  him home, and in my car he opened his mouth and spoke, and
                  what he said became engraved on my mind. „Who is Professor
                  Auden?" he asked. "Tell me about him. Is he an important man?"
                  This is the cue for a story which, though with names
                  omitted, should be placed on record. It must have been in
                  about 1949 or 1950 that an American woman was travelling by
                  train in Austria. In the carriage were two Austrian boys
                  in their early teens. The three got into conversation, the woman
                  asked a number of questions and heard the boys' story. Their
                  father was an artist, they lived in a village on a lakeside and
                  went to the local high school. Yes, they would be leaving school
                  at fifteen, one of them would go as an apprentice to the local
                  printer's. No, there was no money for further education, there
                  was no grammar school nearby, the family couldn't afford boarding
                  school fees, nor lodgings. Not long after this chance encounter
                  the family heard that Auden would like to pay for the boys
                  education. They went through grammar school in Innsbruck and
                  never looked back; both made swift careers in industry. I have
                  the impression that Auden did meet the family in later years;
                  nothing was ever further from my mind than to bring up the story
                  with Auden. It was disinterested generosity of a rare order.
                  In the light of this kindness to Austrian citizens, it is axx
                  sad, and ironical too, that his final years in Austria
                  should have brought him into conflict with the tax authorities.
                  He had felt at peace in Kirchstetten:
                  Here, though, I feel as at home
                  as you did:
                  the same
                  short-lived creatures re-utter
                  the same care-free songs,
                  orchards cling to the regime
                  they know, from April's
                  rapid augment of colour
                  till boisterous Fall,
                  when at each stammering gust
                  apples thump the ground.

                  38.
                  And in his Prologue at Sixty:
                  Though the absence of hedge-rows is odd to me
                  (no Whig landlord, the landscape vaunts,
                  ever empired on Austrian ground),
                  this unenglish tract after ten years
                  into my love has looked itself...
                  But then worry invaded it. While all the time believing
                  himself not to be liable for income tax, debts to the fiscus were
                  in fact running up to such an extent that a mortgage was placed
                  on the property in Kirchstetten. The final amount was A.S.
                  930,000. What this meant to Auden was that instead of being able
                  to take things a bit more easily, he had to pay out pretty well
                  all that he had put on one side, and return to the lecture circuit
                  in the States, a prospect which he viewed with dread.
                  "Do you know" he said to me, "they're accusing me of having
                  been inspired by the Austrian landscape! The Weinheber poem and
                  all that." I said: "You wrote the poem in Berlin“ and he
                  shrugged. At that time I had no idea how serious the whole thing
                  was. As the result of an appeal in high quarters the sum was
                  reduced by about half, and was fully paid up. At some point, the
                  document is undated, Auden composed a statement, consisting of
                  three pages of typescript, giving his point of view in this
                  extraordinary affair. One day, if the whole official correspondence
                  is published, this document with the rest will be numbered among
                  the curiosities of literary history.
                  Having disposed of the "accusations" that he had a "material
                  interest“ in Austria, that he had been awarded she state prize for
                  literature and that a road in Kirchstetten had been named after
                  him (he requested the local authorities, by the way, not to do so
                  until after his death, but they disregarded his wish) he continued:
                  "You go on to say, correctly, that I have written a few
                  poems on Austrian themes. To this I should like to make tkree
                  observations
                  1. I have never received so much as a penny for my poetry in
                  Austria. A few of them were translated into German, but in this
                  case the translators received the money, not I.
                  § The statement is in German translation, what follows is my own
                  re-translation back into English and not the original.

               <p>
                  39.
                  2. I believe you are not aware how it is that poems are
                  written. What is generally taken to be the subject is only
                  a point of view, an occasion, in order to give expression to
                  certain thoughts about nature, about God, history, mankind etc.
                  which the poet may have had in his head for
                  a very long time. I wrote a poem, for instance, for the 20th
                  anniversary of the death of Josef Weinheber. But basically,
                  the poem has to do with other things: firstly with the love
                  which every good poet, of whatever nationality he may be, has
                  for his mother tongue, and secondly with what has happened
                  since the war in the countries that lost it, that is to say,
                  not only Austria, but also Germany and Italy.
                  Then again: in 1964 I wrote a poem with the title
                  „Whitsunday in Kirchstetten“ because I happened to be there
                  at the time. But the place is unimportant. What this poem is
                  actually about is the question: „What is the significance
                  for a Christian of the Feast of Peneecost?' And this applies
                  to all countries alike.
                  3. I believe that you fail to understand the finançial situation
                  of a poet. A novelist can, if he is successful, earn a good
                  deal of money with his books. A poet cannot do that, even if he
                  is very well known, because poems are only read by a minority.
                  Far and awag the greater part of my income derives, therefore,
                  not from the sale of my volumes of verse, but from book reviews,
                  translations, lectures etc., activities which have nothing to do
                  with Austria. And while on the subject of translations: you
                  say correctly, that I have a great interest in German and Austrien
                  literature - I might add, also in its music, but I have no need
                  to come to Austria to read or to hear them."
                  Auden goes on to the length of time spent annually in
                  Austria, and concludes:
                  "One last word. If this in my view utterly unjustified
                  nonsense does not cease, I shall leave Austria never to return,
                  which both for me and pernaps too for the shopkeepers of
                  Kirchstetten would be very sad. But one tning I cannot conceal
                  from you, gentlemen: if this should come about, the consequence
                  might be a scandal of world-wide dimensions.'

                  The news reached me over the car radio on the motorway near
                  Linz, and I headed straight for Kirchstetten on the off-chance
                  that Chester might already have come home. Wystan had died in
                  the night of 28/29 September, and the fact blotted out all else.
                  Why had I gone to Linz and missed his last reading at the
                  Society for Literature? I had talked it over with him a few
                  days earlier, saying that I was exasperated at finding myself
                  committed to a meeting in Linz which I yearned to cut;
                  particularly as I should like him to make use of my flat and
                  perhaps spend the night there. I was glum, and he cheered me
                  up, saying that Id heard it all before, and I must come over
                  afterwards and he'd tell me how it had gone off.
                  There was all too much time on the motorway to react, and I
                  fought against what seemed to be unreasonable waves of emotion.
                  Don't exaggerate, I told myself, don't flatter yourself that
                  you have the right to mourn. Think of Chester. I am thinking
                  of Chester;
                  hardly dare think of him. How will he live?
                  Will he live?
                  The car radio was still muttering quietly. As
                  a distraction, I turned it up and the familar voice of Friedrich
                  Heer reviewing a book was something consoling to hold on to.
                  The green shutters on the door at Kirchstetten were closed,
                  and there was no one there. I wrote a note and stuck it in the
                  centre gap, watched by the Strobls' eternally suspicious mongrel,
                  and drove to Fridau. An answer to the note came by telephone:
                  Chester would like me to come over in the afternoon - by now it
                  was Sunday.
                  The room was full of people. On the seat behind the coffee
                  table sat the pathetic figure whom one instinctively acknowledged
                  as the widow. Mrs. Clark and her daughter had come up from
                  Florence, the mayor of Kirchstetten was there, the headmistress
                  of the high school, Frau Seitz, a writer friend of Chester's
                  called Adolf Opel, and an assortment of unidentified young people.
                  The expressionson the faces of the chief protagonists in what was
                  clearly a heated discussion were not quite what one would expect
                  at a gathering of mourners and local worthies who had come to
                  offer their condolences. The mayor was looking stubborn, 
                  Frau Seitz looked worried, the Clarks puzzled. Chester was hardly
                  coherent; the rest conversed in whispers.

                  Chester tried to explain, and gradually his wishes became
                  clear. He hated everything in the shape of pompes funebres.
                  He wanted Wysten buried quietly and at once, if possible on
                  Tuesday, telegrams had been sent to John Auden, to Stephen
                  Spender and others telling them to come on Tuesday morning or
                  earlier. The mayor, Chester said, wanted a big funeral at the
                  following weekend, with the town band out, a hearse coming to
                  the door, representatives of the Ministry of Education, the Land
                  and all the rest of it. He, Chester, couldn't bear it and
                  wouldn't have it. Knowing Austrian burial customs it was evident
                  that we were faced with a cultural clash of no mean proportions.
                  A hurried private funeral of the kind envisaged by Chester might
                  seem normal in western intellectual circles. In Austria it
                  was an affront to the decencies and carried a whiff of pauperism,
                  suicide or both. Now the mayor had his say. „First of all" he
                  said, "the body has not yet been released. As in all cases of
                  sudden death in a hotel, where the circumstances are not wholly
                  clear, there has had to be an inquest, and even with intervention,
                  these things take time.“ And then: „Imagine not even informing
                  the ministry, the department of culture of the Land government
                  it would be more than my job is worth." Frau Seitz now gave it as
                  her view that Kirchstetten would hardly bury a dog in the way
                  intended by Herr Hallman, let alone a major poet, a man moreover
                  whom they had all known and loved.
                  The discussion continued, the young people drifted like
                  autumn leaves hither and thither, whispering and bearing bottles.
                  Frau Strobl made frequent dramatic entrances for reasons which
                  were never quite clear. It was not, it occurred to us, only a
                  question of when and how much, but: what kind of a funeral service
                  should it be? Auden was a practising member of the Church of
                  England? - or of the Episcopalian Church in the States - but he
                  had regularly attended Mass in the Catholic Church of Kirchstetten
                  and had wished to be buried there. Should not the Anglican
                  chaplain in Vienna be asked to participate?
                  No one' seemed to
                  have any ideas, but it was finally agreed that an ecumenical
                  service would be appropriate, the texts to be spoken being left to
                  John Auden to decide in conjunction with the clergy.
                  § Few people would question this, but in view of two or three
                  statements in the press that he became R.C., the fact perhaps
                  needs emphasising.

                  The room was stifling. It seemed that Chester needed to
                  have fewer people around him and that the party needed to be
                  broken up. The chance came when Chester agreed to have the
                  funeral postponed. fmy memory of events is correct, agreement
                  was first reached only over the vital point that Tuesday was
                  impossible and that people in England should be notified at once,
                  leaving the final date over for the moment. This decision
                  conveniently created a natural pause, and now the Clarks undertook
                  to send the telegrams and were driven to the Bost office by Frau
                  Strobl. We all stood up, Chester came over and asked me to
                  carry on discussions for the funeral arrangements with the mayer
                  and Frau Seitz. It was all, he said, more than he could bear,
                  I must just try to hold the others in check but he would agree
                  to anything I said. He was all right really, he was
                  full to the brim with tranquillisers and only needed a bit of peace
                  We hugged each other warmly and, together with the mayor, I left
                  in Frau Seitz's car and we drove to her house at the other end of
                  the village.
                  This was not the sort of talk in which one can whip through
                  the agenda, and we took our time. If only Chester had realised
                  it, compared with the style in which an Austrian village carries
                  its senior citizens to the grave, what he was being asked to
                  consent to was not a tall order. There would be no voluntary
                  fire brigade, no gamekeepers with their ancient ritual and their
                  wishes for good hunting in the fields of Elysium bellowed into the
                  open grave, no linesmen from the local railway, no representatives
                  of the local football club, marksmen's association et al.
                  And since none of them would be there, they would not have to be
                  fed afterwards. All the mayor wanted was the brass band; I felt
                  that Wystan would have been amused, and might, if he were watching,
                  even enjoy it, and I agreed. Thursday was chosen to keep down
                  the number of idle onlookers, a great concession for which I was
                  grateful. Chester had told me that he had a phobia about hearses
                  being brought to the door. What he wanted was for the coffin to
                  be carried to the bottom of the hill, if not further, and only then
                  placed in the hearse. But the thought of the weighty coffin
                  being carried down a narrow lane, pitted with ruts and potholes
                  and strewn with loose stones, made my hair stand on end. The
                  mayor and Frau Seitz felt the same way, and here too, Chester
                  later agreed to our compromise. Subsequently, I was to blame
                  myself very much for not raising the question of who was to

                  pay for the band. As Chester was being compelled to comply with
                  local customs, and the district council in the person of its mayor
                  wished to honour a citizen who had brought it great fame, it never
                  occurred to me that it was not free of charge. Nor did it occur
                  to Chester, whose anger at being sent in a bill precipated a chain
                  of events which badly hampered the efforts of the Society for
                  Literature to preserve the house as a place of memorial for W.H. Auden.
                  At the time, however, we thought we had troubles enough, and the
                  misunderstanding was born.
                  Meanwhile the mayor was worrying about something else altogeher:
                  the safety of Auden's manuscripts and papers in the attic room.
                  Altogether, he took a distrustful view of the fate of the house and
                  everything in it once Chester went back to Athens. He was afraid
                  that in his state of despair and nervous exhaustion Chester might
                  agree to almost anything that was suggested to him with sufficient
                  to
                  force or calculation. But to pursue this subject furthermoe
                  reach out too far beyond the death of Auden.
                  When I got back to the house it was to find Chester in a calmer
                  frame of mind and body and able to talk in that gentle and
                  affectionate way, with occasional burst of sardonic humour, which
                  his friends will remember, overlooking all else.
                  In attempting a memoir of Auden in his latter years it would be
                  unreasonable to leave Chester Kallman to play a purely walking on
                  part, the more so as in articles by visitors to Kirchstetten
                  Chester was invariably the fall-guy. It would be very difficult fer
                  fully to understand the relationship between Auden and Kallman, and
                  it never seemed to me that it was any business of mine to try to do so.
                  But I saw something of Chester without Wystan: during the winter
                  that he spent alone in Vienna in a flat in the Esslarhgasse not far
                  from my own, and when he was in hospital in St.Pölten for treatment.
                  He was a person full of contrasts where vulgarity and second-rate
                  humour and tastes lived side by side with a remarkable personal
                  sensitivity and with talent and discrimination in the spheres of
                  literature and music. It seems clear from their writings alone,
                  that when both men went their own ways in sexual matters, Auden s
                  heart was not involved, whereas Kallman s nelationship with Jean
                  Boras was both passlonate and emotionally degrading. Both men
                  needed each other and perhaps it would have been better ir Chester

                  had never left New York for Athens. Apart, both lapsed into
                  squalor; together, they kept the pot boiling and the stove
                  crackling. The daily routine was maintained, drink disciplined
                  and loneliness banished. When Boras died, Auden wondered how
                  Kallman would get througn the Austrian summer. When Auden died,
                  Kallman pined away.
                  The gatnering in the livingroom on the eve of the funeral
                  prompted that banal, well-known reflection about how much the
                  deceased would have enjoyed it. There was the comforting presence
                  of John Auden, Stephen Spender was there, David Luke, the Clarks,
                  Sonia Orwell. There were no more conflicts of interest, no more
                  cultural confrontations, merely a group of people bent on
                  mutual consolation.
                  Then Auden dame home to Kirchstetten, that un-English tract.
                  He had celebrated Kirchstetten village, the church where he sang
                  so flat and now lies buried, and the house he lived. He had
                  celebrated Josef Weinheber, Franz Jägerstätter, Emma Eiermann
                  and the cats. He had celebrated the whole quiet, unexciting
                  landscape and its war-torn past and even the autobahn which lies
                  between the church and his home, biseding the invisible line
                  joining one to the other. Though as we known from his statement
                  for the taxation people, he would not want us to take him too
                  literally. „What is taken to be the subject of a poem is only a
                  point of view, an occasion, in order to give expression to certain
                  thoughts abeut nature, about God..."
                  In other words:
                  To speak is human because human to listen,
                  beyond hope, for an Eighth Day,
                  when the creature's Image shall become the Likeness:
                  Giver-of-Life, translate for me
                  till I accomplish my corpse at last.
