                  21 November 1981
                  Dear Stella,
                  Delighted you got that EARLY AUDEN, and even more delighted you find
                  it worth looking into. Is it a universal experience among authors to
                  be surprised that someone actually reads one's book? I'm so familiar
                  with the thing by now, and so aware of its deficiencies, that I wish
                  I could recall the edition and rewrite the whole book from the start.
                  Luckily, teaching, reviewing and miscellaneous annoyances keep the
                  mind elsewhere. One of those miscellaneous annoyances was a move
                  from my old flat to another one on the same floor in the same building.
                  The new address is up above, and the only change is in the apartment
                  number. Phone number still 212 222-0679.
                  Yes, I saw the young man who was doing advance work for Robert Robinson,
                  but haven't heard from him since July. I gather that work progresses,
                  though. There was an hour on Wystan on BBC Radio the other week-a
                  "dramatization" with an actor reading the poems and lots of ominous
                  noises off. I'm told it was fairly dreadful, but perhaps the TV film
                  will be better. I saw quite a good one from the BBC on Benjamin Britten.
                  Its only fault--and I'm not sure this was a fault, given the usual tone
                  of TV journalism-was an awed tone of worship.
                  Easy answers to important questions. Those two volumes by and about
                  Auden sound very attractive. (Which publisher is interested?) The
                  place to write for permissions is to the agents, specifically, to
                  Maureen Walters
                  Curtis Brown Ltd
                  575 Madison Avenue

                  Mention my name, and things will be easier. But they should be easy
                  anyway.
                  Now let me beg you for an easy answer. I've heard from at least two
                  different people that they had seen (or knew someone else who had seen)
                  a German text of your Wystan memoir in print. Are they right, or are
                  they confusing this with an occasion when you read it aloud (and it was
                  reported)? I had an Austrian student here this summer working on Wystan,
                  and I wanted to tell her about the piece, but didn't know where to find
                  it. Please, please tell me if you printed it, and if so, where. No need
                  for a long letter: just a "No, calm down, I never printed it" or a "Yes,
                  it appeared in such-in-such a journal" would be more than enough. This is
                  the one minor mystery of writings-about-Wystan I haven't been able to solve,
                  so please do help.
                  Have I told you any of my news? I'm now at Columbia University permanently,
                  if I want to be. I have a flat with a small guest room and bath-so please
                  take note if you're in this country for any reason. I have a lady friend,
                  the first whom I expect to be with for a very long time, and we are quite
                  happy about things in general. Next June we'll be in Europe, certainly in
                  Paris, possibly father south, although we may put off the southern trip
                  for another year or so. I haven't been across the Atlantic this year; too

                  preoccupied, too broke, too much to do in New York to feel much of an
                  My years in New Haven always left me panting to
                  impulse to get away.
                  get overseas, but now I feel at home again.
                  Did you see Humphrey Carpenter's book on Wystan? Not bad, as biographies
                  go, but not very deep either. It seems to have most of the facts right,
                  which is something. Now a life of Chester is being written, by the woman
                  who recently married Chester's father, and who knew Chester since 1942.
                  Full of surprises and purple passages; Chester would be pleased, I think,
                  although I don't like to imagine how Wystan would have taken it.
