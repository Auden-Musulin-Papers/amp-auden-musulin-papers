                  (<unclear>1</unclear>
               </p>
               <p>
                  Sehr veehrter Herr Landeshauptman<unclear>n,</unclear>meine Damen und Herren:<lb/>
                  I hope you will pardon me if I speak somewhat personally.  I do so,<lb/>
                  not out of vanity,but bec<del>ua</del><unclear>au</unclear>se  I do <del>j</del>not wish to give the impression that I<lb/>
                  am attempting to lay down absolute laws which are valid for all.  I give you my<lb/>
                  experience<unclear>s</unclear> as a poet,in the hope that you will be able to compare the<del>,</del>m with<lb/>
                  yours<del><unclear>own</unclear></del>,and form your own judgment about them.<lb/>
                  Most of what I <del>o</del>know about the writing of poetry,or at least about the kind I<lb/>
                  am interested in writing,I discovered long before I took any interest in poetry<lb/>
                  itself.<lb/>
                  Between the ages of six and twelve,I spent a great many of my waking hours in<lb/>
                  the fab<del><unclear>o</unclear></del>rication of a private secondary sacred world,the basic elements of which<lb/>
                  were <del>a<unclear>O</unclear></del> a) a limestone landscape mainly derived from the Pennine Moors in the<lb/>
                  North of England and b) an industry - lead-mining.<lb/>
                  It is no doubt psychologically significant that my sacred world was autistic -<lb/>
                  that is to say,I had no wish to share it with others no<del>t</del>r could I have done so.<lb/>
                  However,though constructed for and inhabited by myself alone,I needed the help of<lb/>
                  others,my parents in particular,in collecting its basic materials; others had to<lb/>
                  procure for me the necessary text-books on geology and machinery,maps,catalog<del>i</del>ues,<lb/>
                  guide-books and photographs,and,when occasion offered<unclear>,</unclear><del>to</del> ta<del>l</del>ke me down real mines,<lb/>
                  tasks which they performed with unfailing patience and generosity.<lb/>
                  From this activity,I learned certain principles which I was later to find applied<lb/>
                  to all artistic fabrication. First,whatever other elements it may include,the<lb/>
                  initial impulse to create a secondary world is a fe<del><unclear>o</unclear></del>eling of awe aroused by<lb/>
                  encounters,in the Primary World,with sacred beings or events.  This feeling of awe<lb/>
                  is an imperative,that is to´ say,one is not free to choose the object or the event<lb/>
                  that arouses it. Though every work of art is a secondary world,it cannot be<lb/>
                  constructed ex nihilo,but is a selection from and a recombination of the contents of<lb/>
                  the Primary World. Even the 'purest' poem,in the French Symboliste sense,is<lb/>
                  made of words which are not the poet's private property,but the communal creation<lb/>
                  of the linguistic group to whom he belongs,so that their meaning can be looked up<lb/>
                  in a dictionary.<lb/>
                  Secondly,in constructing my private world,I discovere<del>s</del>d that,though this was<lb/>
                  a game,or rather precisely because it was a game - that is to say,not a necessity<lb/>
                  like eating or sleeping,but something I was free to do or not as I chose - it<lb/>
                  could not be played without rules. Absolute freedom is meaningless: freedom can<lb/>
                  only be realised in a choice between alternati<del>c</del>ves. A secondary world,be it a poem,<lb/>
                  or a game of football or bridge,must be as much a world of law as the Primary,the<lb/>
                  only difference being that in the world of games one is free to decide what its<lb/>
                  laws shall be. But to all games as to real life,Goethe's lines apply.<lb/>
                  In der Beschr<unclear>ä</unclear>nkung zeigt sich erst der Meister,<lb/>
                  Und d<del>s</del>as Gesetz nur kann uns Freiheit geben.<lb/>
                  As regards my particu<del>al</del>l<unclear>a</unclear>r lead-mining world,I decided,or rather,without conscious<lb/>
                  decision I instinctively felt,that I must impose two restrictions upon my freedom<lb/>
                  of fantasy. In choosing what objects were to be included,I was free to select this<lb/>
                  and reject that,on condition that both were real objects in the Primary World,to<lb/>
                  choose,for example,between two kinds of water-turbine,which could be found in a<lb/>
                  text-book  on mining machinery or a manufacturer's catalogue: but I was not free<lb/>
                  to invent one.  In deciding how my world was to function,I <del>was </del> could choose between<lb/>
                  t<del><unclear>oe</unclear></del><unclear>w</unclear>o practical possibilit<del>es</del>ies  - a mine can be drained either by an adit or a pump -<lb/>
                  <unclear>b</unclear>ut physic<unclear>a</unclear>l impossibili<del>es</del>ties and magic means were forbidden. <del><unclear>T</unclear></del>When I say forbidden,<lb/>
                  I mean that I felt,in some obscure way,t<unclear>ha</unclear>t they were morally forbidden. Then there<lb/>
                  came a day when the moral issue became quite conscious. As I was planning my<lb/>
                  Platonic Idea of a concentrating-mill,I ran into difficulties. I had to choose<lb/>
                  between two types of a cer<del>at</del>tain machine for separating the sli<unclear>m</unclear>es,called a buddle.<lb/>
                  One type I found more sacred or '<del>beat<unclear>i</unclear>ful</del> beautiful',but the other type was,I<lb/>
                  knew from my reading,the more efficient. At this point I realised that it was my<lb/>
                  moral duty to sacrifice my <del>aethetic</del> aesthetic preference to re<unclear>a</unclear>lity or truth.
