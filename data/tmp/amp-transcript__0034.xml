                  Dear Baroness Musulin,
                  I remember you telling me that you liked the novels of
                  Molly Keane when I visited you with Peter Muller in October of last year. I
                  was delighted to see that Virago Press have decided to reprint her early
                  novels and I thought of you when I saw them in the bookshops. I am sending
                  you herewith The Rising Tide - the first in the series of reprints and I very
                  much hope you enjoy reading it.
                  I remember with great affection our chat about W.H. Auden
                  and I am very grateful to you for sharing those memories with me. Plans for
                  
                  the Auden Exhibition in the Kunstlerhaus are now very far advanced. I have
                  put togther a complete collection of Auden's first editions, selections from
                  his contributions to periodicals, representative anthologies, his films for
                  the G.P.O Film Unit, many items connected with his work for the Group Theatre,
                  all the opera libretti, Britten's arrangements of his poems and many other items.
                  I have also arranged for various portraits of Auden to be sent to Vienna ; they
                  include Sir William Coldstreams 1937 portrait, a portrait by Mervyn Peake painted
                  in the same year, two drawings by Maurice Field and a portrait by Don Bachardy.
                  I have also managed to get 20 lithographs by Henry Moore which he did in 1973 to
                  illustrate a selection of Auden's poems.
                  Stephen Spender has agreed to come to Vienna during the
                  period of the Exhibition - that is 11th October to 3rd November. Humphrey
                  Carpenter will lecture on Auden at the invitation of the British Council, so it
                  all promises to be a splendid celebration of Auden's life and work.
                  I was terribly disappointed not to have seen you when I was
                  in Vienna in March but alas I was at the mercy of my friends who have cars and,
                  as luck would have it,they were all so busy at various things I wasstranded in
                  Vienna throughout my brief visit. However I shall be spending September, October
                  and November in Austria and I very much look forward to seeing you then.
                  I had a letter from Edward Mendelson yesterday and he asked
                  me to send you his very best wishes which I do along with my own. I hope this
                  better behaved in Austria than
                  finds you in good spirits and that Summer is
                  it is here in Ireland.
                  With all good wishes,
                  Yours very sincerely,
                  MICHAEL O'SULLIVAN.
