               <p>
                  Sehr veephter Herr Landeshauptman, meine Damen und Herren:
                  I hope you will pardon me if I speak somewhat personally. I do so,
                  not out of vanity, but becaase I do pot wish to give the impression that I
                  am attempting to lay down absolute laws which are valid for all. I give you my
                  experiences as a poet, in the hope that you will be able to compare them with
                  yoursm, and form your own judgment about them.
                  Most of what I know about the writing of poetry,or at least about the kind I
                  am interested in writing, I discovered long before I took an interest in poetry
                  itself.
                  Between the ages of six and twelve, I spent a great many of my waking hours in
                  the fabrication of a private secondary sacred world, the basic elements of which
                  were  a) a limestone landscape mainly derived from the Pennine Moors in the
                  North of England and b) an industry - lead-mining.
                  It is no doubt psychologically significant that my sacred world was autistic
                  that is to say, I had no wish to share it with others nor could I have done so.
                  However, though constructed for and inhabited by myself alone, I needed the help of
                  others,my parents in particular, in collecting its basic materials; others had to
                  procure for me the necessary text-books on geology and machinery, maps, catalogues,
                  guide-books and photographs, and, when occasion offered, talte me down real mines,
                  tasks which they performed with unfailing patience and generosity.
                  From this activity, I learned certain principles which I was later to find applied
                  to all artistic fabrication. First, whatever other elements it may include, the
                  initial impulse to create a secondary world is a feeling of awe aroused by
                  encounters, in the Primary World, with sacred beings or events. This feeling of awe
                  is an imperative, that is to say,one is not free to choose the object or the event
                  that arouses it. Though every work of art is a secondary world,it cannot be
                  constructed ex nihilo, but is a selection and recombination of the contents of
                  the Primary World. Even the 'purest' poém, in the French Symboliste sense, is
                  made of words which are not the poet's private property, but the communal creation
                  of the linguistic group to whom he belongs,so that their meaning can be looked up
                  in a dictionary.
                  Secondly, in constructing my private world, I discovered that, though this was
                  a game, or rather precisely because it was a game - that is to say,not a necessity
                  like eating or sleeping, but something I was free to do or not as I chose - it
                  could not be played without rules. Absolute freedom is meaningless: freedom can
                  only be realised in a choice between alternatives. A secondary world, be it a poem,
                  or a game of football or bridge,must be as much a world of law as the Primary, the
                  only difference being that in the world of games one is free to decide what its
                  laws shall be. But to all games as to real life, Goethe's lines apply.
                  In der Beschränkung zeigt sich erst der Meister,
                  Und das Gesetz nur kann uns Freiheit geben.
                  As regards my particur lead-mining world, I decided, or rather, without conscious
                  decision I instinctively felt, that I must impose two restrictions upon my freedom
                  of fantasy. In choosing what objects were to be included, I was free to select this
                  and reject that, on condition that both were real objects in the Primary World,to
                  choose,for example, between two kinds of water-turbine, which could be found in a
                  text-book on mining machinery or a manufacturer's catalogue: but I was not free
                  to invent one. In deciding how my world was to function, I xz could choose between
                  two practical possibilitses - a mine can be drained either by an adit or a pump
                  but physical impossibilities and magic means were forbidden. When I say forbidden,
                  I mean that I felt, in some obscure way, that they were morally forbidden. Then there
                  came a day when the moral issue became quite conscious. As I was planning my
                  Platonic Idea of a concentrating-mill, I ran into difficulties. I had to choose
                  between two types of a cerinin machine for separating the slimes, called a buddle.
                  One type I found more sacred or ' beautiful',but the other type was, I
                  knew from my reading,the more efficient. At this point I realised that it was my
                  moral duty to sacrifice my aesthetic preference to reality or truth.

                  2
                  When, later, I began to write poetry I found that, for me, at least, the same
                  obligation was binding. That is to say, I cannot accept the domctrine that, in
                  poetry, there is a 'suspension of beliefm'. A poet must never make a statement
                  simply because it sounds poetically exciting: he must also belteve it to be
                  true. This does not mean, of course, that one can only appreciate a poet whose
                  beliefs happen to co-incide with one's own. It does mean, however, that one must
                  he convinced that the poet really believes what he says, however odd  the
                  belief may seem to oneself.
                  Between constructing a private fantasy world for oneself alone
                  and writing poetry, there is, of course, a profound difference. A
                  fantasy world exists only in the head of its creator: a poem is a public
                  verbal object intended to be read and enjoyed by others. To become conscious
                  of others is to become conscious of historical timein various ways. The
                  contents of a poem are necessarily past  experiences, and the goal of
                  a poem is necessarily in the future, since it cannot be read until
                  it has been written. Again to write a poem is to engage in anactivity which
                  human beings have practised for centuries. If one asks why human beings
                  make poems or paint pictures or compose music, I can see two possible answers.
                  Firstly all the artistic media are forms of an activity pecul/iar to human
                  beings, namely,Personal Speech. Many animals have impersonal codes of
                  communications, visual, olfactory, auditory signals, by which they convey to
                  other members of their species vital information about food,territory, sex,
                  the presence of enemies etc, and in social animals like the bee, such
                  a code may be exceedingly complex. We, too, of course, often use words in the same
                  way, as when I ask a stranger the way to the railroad station. But when we
                  truly speak, we do something quite different. We speak as person to person
                  in order to disclose ourselves to others and share our experednces with
                  them, not because we must, but becuase we enjoy doing so. This activity is
                  sometimes quite erroneously called 'self-expression'. If I write a poem
                  about experiences I have had, I do sox becuse I think it
                  be of interest and value to others: the fact that it has till now
                  only been my experpønce is accidental. What the poet or any artist has to convey
                  is a perception of a reality common to all, but seen from a unique perpsective,
                  which it is his duty as well as his pleasure to share with others. To small
                  truths as well as great,St Augustine's words apply.
                  The truth is neither mine nor his nor another's; but belongs
                  to us all whom Thou callest to partake of it: warning us
                  terribly,not to account it private to ourselves, lest we be
                  deprived of it.
                  Then the second impulse to artistic fabrication is the desire to transcend
                  our mortality,by making objects which, unlike ourselves, are not subject to
                  natural death, but can remain  permanently 'on hand' in the world,
                  long after we and our society have perished.
                  Every genuine work of art, I believe, exhibits two qualities, Nowness and
                  Permanence. By Nowness I mean the quality which enables an art-historian
                  to date a work,at least, approximately. If,for example, one listens to
                  a composition by Palestrina and one by Mozart, one knows immediately that,
                  quite aside from their artistic merits, Palestrina must have lived earlier
                  than Mozart: he could not possibly have written as he did after Mozart.
                  By Bermanence, I mean that the work continues to have relevance and
                  importance loug after its creator is dead. In the history of Art, unlike
                  the history of Science, no genuine work of art is made obsolete by a
                  later work. Past science is of interest only to the historian of science, not
                  to what scientists are doing at this moment. Past works of art, on the
                  other hand, are of the utmost importance to the contemporary
                  practicoer. Every artist tries to produce something new, but in the hope
                  that, in time, it will take its proper place in the tradition of his art.
                  And he cannot produce anything significantly original unless he knows
                  well what has been already done,wi, that is to say he cannot
                  rebel' against the past without having a profound reverence for it.

                  There are periods in history when xx the arts develop uninterruptedly,
                  each generation building on the achievements of the previous generation.
                  There are other periods when radical breaks seem to be necessary. However,
                  when they are, one will generally find that the 'radical' artist does not
                  disown the past, but finds in works of a much earlier period or ex
                  thosgof culture than his own, the clué to what he should do now.
                  In my own case, for example, I know how much I owe to Anglo-Saxon and
                  Medieval Poetry.
                  When I  review the contemporary artistic scene, it strikes me how
                  extraordinarily fortunate men like Stravinsky, Picasso, Eliot,
                  etc, that is, those persons we think of as the founders of 'modern' art,
                  were in being born when they were, so that they came to manhood before
                  I9I4. Until the x First World War, western society was still pretty much
                  what it had been in the nineteenth century. This meant that for these artists,
                  the felt need to create something new arose from an artistic imperative,
                  not a historic imperative. No one asked himself: "What is the proper
                  kind of music to compose or picture to paint or poem to write in the year
                  I9I2.?" Secondly, their  contemporary audiences, were mostly
                  conservative, but honestly so. Those,for instance, who were scandalised by
                  Le Sacre du Printemps,may seem to us now to have been old fogies, but
                  their reaction was genuine. They did not say to themselves: "Times have
                  changed and we must change with them in order xx not to
                  be left behind."
                  Here are a few statements by Stravinsky to  which the young,
                  artists or critics would do well to listen and x ponder over.

                  In my youth the new music grew out of, and in reaction to, traditions,
                  whereas it appears to be evolving to-day as much from social needs
                  as interior artistic ones...The status of  new music as a
                  category is another incomparable. It had none at all in my early
                  years, being in fact categorically opposed,and often with real
                  hostility. But the unsuccess of composers of my generation at
                  least kept them from trading on success, and our unsuccess may have
                  been less insidious than the automatic superlatives which nowadays
                  kill the new by absorbing it to death.
                  
                  The use of the new hardware naturally appears to the new musician
                  as "historically imperative"; but music is made out of musical
                  imperatives, and the awareness of historical processes is probably
                  best left to future and different kinds of wage-earners.
                  
                  In times,like our own,of rapid social change and political crisis, there is
                  always a danger of confusing the principles governing political action and
                  those governing artistic fabrication. The most important of such confusmions
                  are three.
                  Firstly, one may come to, think of artistic fabrication as a f of political
                  action. Every citizen,  included, has a duty to be politically 'engage'
                  that is, to play a responsible part in seeing that the society of which
                  he is a member shall function properly and improve. But the poet, qua poet,
                  has only one political function. elanguage is his medium, it is his duty,
                  by his own example, to defend his mõtr-tongue against corruption by demagogues,
                  journalists,the mass-media etc. As Karl Kraus said: „Die Sprache ist die 
                  Mutter, nicht das Magd, des  Gedankens", and when language loses its meaning,
                  its  place is taken by violence. Of course,the poet may use poltical and
                  social events as subject-matter for poems - they are as much a part of human
                  experience as love or nature - but he must never imagine that his poems have
                  the power to affect the course of history. The politic al and social history
                  of Europe weuld be what it xx has been if Dante, Shakepeare, Goethe, Michale
                  Angelo, Titman, Mozart, Beethoven, ec, had never existed.

                  Where political and social  evils are concerned,only
                  two things are effectiver political action and straightforward, truthful,
                  detailed journalistic rapportage of the facts. The Arts are powerless.
                  The second confusion, of which Plato is the most famous example, is to take
                  artistic fabrication as the model for a good society. 
                  Such a model,if put into practice, is bound to produce a tyrrany. The aim of
                  the artist is to produce an object which is complete and will endure without
                  change.  In the 'city' of a poem,there are always the same inhabitants doing
                  exactly the same jobs for ever. A society which was really like a good poem,
                  embodying the aesthetic virtues of order, economy and subordination of the detail
                  to the whole, would be a nightmare of horror for, given the historical reality of
                  actual men, such a society could come into being through selective breeding,
                  exxermination of the physically and mentally unfit, absolute obedience to
                  its Birector, a alrge slave claas kept out of sight in Gellars and the
                  strictest censufehip of the Arts, forbidding anything to be said which xx is
                  out of keeping with the official 'line.
                  The third confusion, typical of our western  'free'
                  societies at this time,is the opposite of Plato's,namely to take political
                  action as the model for artistic fabrication. Political action is a necessity,
                  that is to say, a very moment something has to be done, and it
                  is momentary - action at this moment is immeiately followed by another action
                  at the next. Artistic fabrication, on the other hand, is  voluntary¬
                  the alternative to one work of art can be no work of art - and the artistic
                  object is permanent, that is to say, immune to historical change. The attempt
                  to model artistic fabrication os political action can therefore,only
                  reduce it to momentary and arbitrary 'happenings', a conformism with
                  the tyrrany of the immediate moment which is far more enslaving and
                  11
                  uescht
                  destructive of integrity than any conformism with past tradition.
                  What then, can the Arts do for us? In my opinion, they can do two things.
                  e
                  They can, as Dr Johnson said,'enable us a little better to enjoy life or a
                  little better to e it". And, because they are objects
                  permanently on hand in the world, they are the chief means by which the
                  living are able to break bread with the dead, and, without a communication
                  with the dead, I do not believe that a fully human civilised life is possible.
                  Perhaps, too, in our age, the mere making of a work of art is itself a
                  political act. So long as artists exist,making what they please or think
                  they ought to make, even if their works are not terribly good,they
                  remind the Management of something managers need to be reminded of, namely,
                  that the managed are people with faces, not anonymous numbers, that Homo
                  Laborans is also Homo Ludens.
                  And now, I hope those of you who know no English will forgive me is
                  I concludet these remarks with a light poem of my own, entitled
                  Doggerel  by a Senior Citizen.

                  At this point, a little digression on the subject of 'free' verse, which
                  seems now to be almost universal among young poets. Though excellent
                  examples, the poems of D.H.Lawrence, for example, exist, in my opinen they are, - we, dene
                  the exception, not the rule. The great virtue of formal metrical rules is
                  that they forbid automatic  responses and, by forcing the poet
                  to have second thoughts, free im foxm the fetters of self. All too often, the
                  result of not having a fixed form to be true to, is a self-indulgence which in
                  the detached reader can only cause boredom. Further, in my experence ,contrary
                  to what one might expect, the xx free-verse poets sound much more
                  like each other than those who write in fixed forms. Whatever freedom may do,
                  it does not, it would seem,make for originality.
