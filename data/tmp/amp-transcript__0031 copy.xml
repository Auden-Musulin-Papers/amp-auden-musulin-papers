                  Fridau
                  A-3200 Obergrafendorf
                  bei St. Pölten, Austria.
                  15 Dedember 1985.
                  Dear Ed,
                  The time has come to send out a signal to you from this
                  ancient, scandal-ridden, provincial dump. Peter Müller has
                  not been sleeping over his plan to edit a book on Auden s
                  time here, he has been writing books himself in addition to
                  his full time profession. Now - you may know this - it is
                  definite and the book is to come out in February 1987 in
                  time for A s 80th.
                  So he got me back to my desk, to, in his words, combine
                  my English and German texts, and bring the whole thing up to
                  date. „Write as fully as you can, double the length." I
                  protested that a) I don twish to chatter more feebly than I
                  have already, b) I am ancient and frail, also lazy, c) the
                  first MSS only approximate to each other while containing mkuch
                  the same material; their tone differs. But above all they
                  have, whether bad or indifferent, a certain shape or form and
                  you cannot just stuff more material into it which refers to
                  things which happened subsequently. So we agreed that we would
                  leave the texts to stand and that I would say, roughly, okay,
                  that was how it looked then; what has happened since, what
                  is there still be said by us, who knew Auden in Kirchstetten
                  in view of the fact that Carpenter did no research on this
                  locations? For a long time the idea was only to write a
                  German text, I mean that the book would be solely German
                  language production, and this I thought until quite recently.
                  Suddenly, Peter bounced me with the comment that he would
                  "like an English version as well." I had thought my two texts
                  were only to be combined and the sequel written in German.
                  This presents technical problems. For example, and now my
                  questions to you begin:
                  We ihave here a copy of Auden s declaration to the tax
                  authorities. (I have been determined all along that this
                  document should be published AND RIGHT HERE. Apart from making
                  Them look stupid, it must be unique in literary history that a
                  great poet should explain to the tax authorities how poetry
                  comes to be written.) Do you have the English original, or where
                  is it; did it ever exist or was the German drafted by Auden
                  and put together by, syy, his lawyer? Or could this have been
                  done by whoever it was who wrote the prose version of the
                  Weinheber poem? I have that text which A. gave me, but there
                  is no record of who wrote it. In my first draft of the talk
                  given at the PEN Club in London in 1976 I wrote: „I have the
                  statement in German translation, so that what I am reading is
                  my own re-translation back into English and not the original.
                  I should be very grateful if you could help me over the
                  address which Auden held at Neulengbach. I have the original
                  English text which to my horror Auden asked me to translate:
                  although capable of creative writing in German, to deal with
                  this tough text was too much and it was corrected by my husband.
                  Müller possesses the German text taken from a tape. Now this
                  English text is so familiasrto me that it deafens me to all
                  or any sources. A digest of it is in the PEN text but I wonder
               </p>

                  to what extent Auden s speech contains hitherto unknown material,
                  any. I said airlly that he had probably said in aal before,
                  if
                  in Secondary Worlds and so on, but this is not true. After a
                  preamble the speech begins:
                  Between the ages of six and twelve, I spent a great many of
                  my waking hours in the fabrication of a private secondary
                  s sacred world, the basic elements of which were a) a limestone
                  landscape mainly derived from the Pennine Moors in the North of
                  England and b) an industry - lead-mining.
                  It is no doubt psychologically significant that my sacred
                  world was autistic - that is to say I had no wish to share
                  and so on.
                  it with others.
                  He goes on to define the Primary and Secondary Worlds; his
                  private world, the restrictions on the freedom of the artist;
                  water-turbines, his Platonic idea of a concentrating mill and
                  of his moral duty to sacrifice his aesthetic xxxxxxxxpreference
                  to reality or truth.
                  If you like I can have the whole thing photo-copied and
                  send it along, but you see what it s about. I cannot believe
                  that Wystan chose Neulengbach to make a one-time-only
                  statement of this length and weight, the idea is absurd and
                  the point of my quotation in my talk in 1976 was to show Auden
                  in one aspect of his contact with the Austrians, not without
                  a touch of hilarity. But this is not in Secondary Worlds,
                  I have leafed through your Early Auden page by page and finkd
                  no reference, nor can I find it anywhere else. Can you
                  elucidate?
                  My worm s eye view of the arrangements for the funeral
                  goes iknto my new piece, and incidentally the contributions
                  will be looked over by a lawyer.
                  Are you about to come out with a Middle Auden or whatever?
                  If so it would be nice to know about it so I can refer to it.
                  The chaplain sto the British Embassy in Vienna gave me the
                  name and address of the clergyman who took the service with the
                  RC pasrish priest and I wrote to him to find out whether he
                  can remember the form of service etc. but no answer so far.
                  This would be of interest here because though common practice
                  in England such an ecumenical service was a novelty here and
                  caused much comment.
                  How are you and what are you doing apast from teaching?
                  I had a lot of illness, hospitals etc. but am now stabilised
                  and am living now wholly in the country but am well looked
                  after and see plenty of people. It s Parkinson s disease
                  which can be kept pretty well under control these days. My
                  relations organised a splendid surprise party for my 70th
                  birthday which went on all day, at breakfast I didn tyet
                  know what lay ahead. My son plotted this and steered it from
                  New York but was there on the day. He built up the Austrian
                  bank Creditanstalt-Bankverein in NY, and if ever you need to
                  send me bulky papers or whatever - not that you will - contact
                  him at 212-702-9101. His mame is Marko.
                  Good health and sucess in 1986,
               </p>
