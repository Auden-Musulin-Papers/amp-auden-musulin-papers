                  In Retrospect.<lb/>
                  Since then the Auden industry has not been idle.  An<lb/>
                  excellent biography was published1 and <del>i</del>kn this the Austrian<lb/>
                  period was dealt with but not locally researched.  Edward<lb/>
                  Mendelson edited Auden´s early works and wrote superb commentaries.<lb/>
                  There has been a biography of Chester Kallman.  Writers of PhD<lb/>
                  theses have been out here and have shaken us up, particularly<lb/>
                  Michael O´Sullivan of Trinity College, Dublin who - not spea<unclear>k</unclear>ing<lb/>
                  a word of German - organised a full-scale exhibition and an<lb/>
                  international symposium in Vienna.  The editor of this volume<lb/>
                  Peter Müller had brought Michael out to see me at Fri<del>d</del>eau in the<lb/>
                  preceding year;  now he came again, and after the closure,<lb/>
                  exhausted, he spent a long weekend in the country to recover.<lb/>
                  We dug out ancient files containing original Auden manuscripts,<lb/>
                  letters, personal notes and newspaper cuttings, and now we tried<lb/>
                  to winnow the wheat from the chaff.  After some general discussion<lb/>
                  it seemed to us all that there remain certain aspects of Auden´s<lb/>
                  life in Lower Austria which are not on record, or where they are,<lb/>
                  not from the worm´s eye view.  As an older man he was happier<lb/>
                  here than anywhere else:  he felt at home.  He was at Kirchstette<unclear>n</unclear><lb/>
                  not only during the summer, <del>i</del>as is often said, but with<lb/>
                  interruptions for five months, depending on his engagements.<lb/>
                  In the course of these years he was still highly <del>productive</del><lb/>
                  creative.  So that it might, we thought, be of value to put some<lb/>
                  of those things on record which would otherwise be lost.  Not<lb/>
                  for the first time self<del>.</del>-criticism was expressed, but while doubts<lb/>
                  concerning self-importance<del>s</del>and sell-out of f<del>i</del>riendship were not<lb/>
                  entirely banished, the view prevailed that the local witness<lb/>
                  needs to be put on paper.  Scholarship is at work elsewhere;<lb/>
                  here a few appendices and footnotes are on offer.<lb/>
                  Auden´s opinions on biographies of creative artists in general<lb/>
                  were, as Humphrey Carpenter pointed out, highly contradictory.<lb/>
                  Again and again he said that the private life of poets and other<lb/>
                  people engaged in creative work is none of the public´s business<lb/>
                  but he also said:´`The biography of an artist, if his life as a w<unclear>hole</unclear><lb/>
                  was sufficiently interesting, is permissible, provided that the<lb/>
                  biographer and his readers realise that such an account throws no<lb/>
                  light whatsoever upon the artist´s work."  And "I do believe,<lb/>
                  however, that, more often than most people realise, <del>k</del>his works<lb/>
                  may throw light upon his life."<lb/>

                  Carpenter´s book calls itself "a first biography", and the<lb/>
                  author expressly restricts his aims:  "It is not a work of literary<lb/>
                  criticism".  It may also be felt to lack an analysis of some<lb/>
                  fundamental questions:  about the depths of the poet´s personality,<lb/>
                  his "otherness" (to confine this to his homosexuality would be to<lb/>
                  oversimplify) and the basis of his all-important relationship<lb/>
                  with Chester Kallman.  As a star<del>it</del>ting point, "Early Auden"1 which<lb/>
                  presents an<del>d</del>s comments on the poetry, drama and prose up to 1939<lb/>
                  is most valuable, and Edward Mendelson will produce further works<lb/>
                  of scholarship.<lb/>
                  What would Wystan Auden say if he could read "Auden in Love"<lb/>
                  by Chester´s old coll<del>a</del>ege friend and last-minute stepmother Dorothy<lb/>
                  J. Farnon?2  In July 1985 the Sunday Times published a list of<lb/>
                  recommended holiday <del>books</del> reading.  The assessment of "Auden in<lb/>
                  Love" was a model of compression:  "emetic but compulsive".<lb/>
                  I more than once came up against Auden´s idée fixe about the<lb/>
                  irrelevance of the poet´s private self, and asked him one day:<lb/><lb/>
                  "So no rotting apples in the desk drawer?"  "No, no rotting apples<lb/>
                  "And if you have an attack of the trots and interrupt your work?"<lb/>
                  "That would make no difference at all."  Chester´s sole explanatio<unclear>n</unclear><lb/>
                  was that it was "a tick like any other", and that in any case he<lb/>
                  was totally inconsistent.  Be that as it may, if the effect on the<lb/>
                  general public was judged as emetic, Auden´s nausea can be<lb/>
                  imagined.  All the same, it is a fascinating book, and for people<lb/>
                  who knew the two men only in <del>r</del>t<unclear>h</unclear>e <unclear>l</unclear>ater years of their lives, does thro<unclear>w</unclear><lb/>
                  light on apparently conflicting phenomena and makes their actions,<lb/>
                  and Chester' s character in particular, more comprehensible.<lb/>
                  When Auden first met Kallman he was just 32 and already a poet<lb/>
                  with an established reputation, respected and even revered on<lb/>
                  many a campus.  Kallman was an 18 year old undergraduate,<lb/>
                  brilliant, beautiful, focal<del>l</del>point and leader of a crowd of young<lb/>
                  intellectuals of both sexes.  He was a Dorian Grey figure,<lb/>
                  sparkling<del>a</del>and damned, hero and victim, immature and over-ripe,<lb/>
                  sensitive and heartless, a man capable of loving and of being<lb/>

                  loved but who was already - though Auden did not know it -
                  adddited to promiscuity. In literature and music his knowledge
                  was, for his age, above average, but when important examinations
                  loomed a kind of petulant mood would come over him and he would
                  fail to appear.
                  Chester never wanted to earn his living, and all his life he wa
                  supported financially by other people, particularly by Auden.
                  He usually promptly lost what he was given because he was
                  perpetually being robbed by seämen picked up on the wharfs of
                  New York. By one of them he was robbed of three months income
                  in succession. Or else he gave it away: no matter what actually
                  happened, the money left his pocket.
                  The scene shifts to a flat in the Esslingasse in Vienna' s
                  3rd District, where Kallman once spent the winter. He gave a
                  party one evening, and afterwards I took two or three of the men
                  part of their way home in my car. When Chester told me later on
                  that the men who, as it chanced, had been sitting beside me, had
                  gone off with 2,000 schillings taken out of the pocket of a
                  jacket hanging on the bedroom door, I could not know that this
                  was not a mere incident but almost a matter of routine. When,
                  ultimately, he took with him to Athens 80,000 sch. in cash
                  (proceeds of the sale of a building plot) and lost it all on the
                  way, this mishap was almost a foregone conclusion.
                  That the sexual relationship between Auden and Kallman
                  ceased as far back as 1961 is well known: from that time on
                  there is evidence in the poetry - sex and love became, for Auden,
                  two separate matters. He felt married to Chester (when he was
                  not Mother) for the rest of his life, and he wrote that Chester
                  was the only person who, emotionally and intellectually, was
                  wholly indispensable to him.
                  Like it or not, this statement has to be accepted with all
                  the weight it carries. It was never possible, even in the
                  Austrian era, to keep Chester in purdah for long, and when there
                  was a visitor from Athens at Hinterholz 6 there could be tension.
                  Auden gave orders to Yannis Boras in the abrupt tones of a
                  colonial Englishman of yore speaking to the "boy", and when I
                  asked one day at lunch: „Where is, er....?" he said with a

                  smirk of satisfaction: "I sent him up on to the roof to mend tiles."
                  But fundamentally nothing had changed between them: this explains
                  Aldentense anxiety over the death of Boras in a car accident in
                  Lower Austria, and his fear communicated itself to me as I searched
                  for Chester in Vienna. It was nearly Christmas, what on earth
                  would become of him, distraught and alone? (He had in fact not
                  gons to Austria after all, but had not let Auden know.) There
                  followed the gloomy summer Df 1969 when Chester was sunk in deep
                  depression while Wystan had a full work programme, and when he
                  told me he could hardly think how Chester would get through the
                  summer this was indeed Mother speaking.
                  What was it in Chester Kallman that made him so entirely
                  indispensable to Auden? Perhaps the question is impossible to
                  answer; some may hold it to be inadmissible, or attempts to find
                  points of reference impertinent. Others again may find the whole
                  subject unappetising. But to anyone with an interest in psychology
                  in the processes of creativity in general and in those of Auden
                  in particular, there is no way of getting round this essential
                  relationship. It may, after all, come to be seen as one of the
                  most curious in the history of English literature.
                  In their love of music, of opera above all, Kallmannwas in
                  the lead. He was a minor poet who wrote because he needed to do so
                  but his output was slight. Yet in many spheres which were of
                  intense interest to Auden he had little, sometimes nothing to offer!
                  German literature (though Chester picked jup languages with uncommer
                  facility; Wystan s spoken German was execrable but his compre-
                  hension unerring), the history of cultures, religion and liturgy,
                  translation. When I was with them Wystan did not only most of the
                  talking, but of the asking as well; his great charm lay in his
                  alert interest in other people s work, and he would draw one out
                  on the odder backwaters of Austrian history. This side of him comes
                  out in a letter dated 6 July 1970. When the historian Friedrich
                  Heer and Kuden, both entranced, struck sparks off one another all
                  afternoon, Kallman was silent. Kallman lacked Auden s sensitivity
                  to places and people,  to the genius loci; perhaps it was just
                  that he was an American, and a New Yorker, while Auden never
                  refers to 1976 text.

                  - 5 -
                  On his own ground, operatic libretti, Chester Kallman was
                  still in good running order, and when the Rake s Progress was put
                  on in Vienna he wrote a letter to Die Presse protesting sharply
                  høver the cuts which had been made by the producer. But of that
                  conversational brilliance which old friends have described there
                  was little sign. A scene comes to mind: Auden was away, and Chester
                  asked me to meet him for lunch at a restaurant off the Kärntner-
                  strasse. A young man whose background clearly lay somewhere
                  within the crime belt near the Prater was with him, and soon the
                  youth sand I were engrossed in conversation, while Chester, feeling
                  out of it, sulked. Immediately after coffee it seemed best to
                  leave them. Chester s intelligence and wit had not deserted him
                  but they had too little scope, and, perhaps owing to his carp-like
                  appearance, he was liable to be underestimated. He was good-natured,
                  in course of time even affectionate, hospitable and amusing. He
                  looked after Auden devotedly and we know that he was able to banish
                  Auden s loneliness as no one else could. His misfortune was that
                  he lacked those qualities which Auden possessed and which decide
                  between success and failure.
                  It cannot, all the same, have been easy living on a long-term
                  basis with Auden in New Yowk while attempting, even though
                  developfitfully,his own personality and talents. Putting up with Auden' s
                  fads, his insistence on punctuality and the rigid routine was one
                  thing; to grow up, to mature in the shadow of this oversized tree
                  was another. There was not enough light. So he fled, but without
                  Mother there was no way he could live at all.
                  It is essentiabl in the light of what happened later on, to
                  remember Auden' s generosity. His biographer mentioned the two boys
                  whose further education was financed by Auden: I can confirm this
                  as we lived next door to them for a few years. They were the sons of
                  an artist; both made rapid careers in industrial management. But
                  there were other examples. Wystan had telephoned and asked me to
                  meet him and Chester at the Operncafe - the much-missed cafe-
                  restaurant next to the Opera, now a car salesroom. They were waiting
                  for Balanchine to join them after the performance, but we waited in
                  vain and fihally gave up and went home. There was a fourth at our
                  table, a silent young man who, Chester said in an undertone, was
                  a student of technology and Wystsa was helping with his studies.

                  off together, and he suddenly broke his silence to ask: "Who
                  is this Professor Auden - is he well known?"

                  Kirchstetten the question cropped iup whether he would be williw
                  to lend the house to a Czech refugee and his wife. By mid-
                  October Auden was in England, and he wrote from London, c/o
                  Heyworth, 32 Bryanston Square:
                  Dear Stella, Got back from Oxford yesterday and found your
                  letter waiting. 1) I think I ought to take the couple in,
                  but I mkust leave it to you to decide whether they are O.K.
                  If they are, all rooms, including my study (which can tbe
                  heated) are open to them. 2) How mch money will they need
                  to keep going? And how shall I make the arrangements for
                  payment. 3) Will they be able to find work or emigrate
                  before I return in April, when I m afraid there will not
                  be room for them? 4) I'm worried about how they will get
                  gas cylinders for cooking from Neulengbach, since, presumably,
                  they have no car. I expect someone in the village will help.
                  5) If and when they come, I must know in advance so that
                  can write a note to the Burgomeister..." (sic).
                  In the end nothing came of mt, but the letter is quoted
                  here because it is so characteristic; the follow-up is even
                  more so.
                  Nov 6th
                  77 St. Mark's Place
                  NYC
                  NY.1003
                  Dear Stella,
                  Many thanks for your letter. Of course,
                  selfishly, I'm rather relieved. How horrid
                  one is!
                  The U.S. is grim.
                  Love,
                  Wystan.
                  Great generosity (these facts, even separatelyare known
                  to no more than two or three people)  in Auden s
                  character quite readily with his legendary stinginess in the
                  small things of everyday life such as stamps or cigarettes.
                  "Life" magazine, he told me one day with a beaming smile, had
                  just paid him 5,000 dollass for an article. "I'm thinking
                  of building on a diningroom." "Very good idea" I said,
                  "but for a start I shall smoke your cigarettes for the rest of
                  the afternoon." I very much doubt whether I did. On the other
                  hand he would order things to be sent out from Vienna awithout
                  a second thought. After his car accident he sent me a message
                  and I drove out to Kirchstetten. He was dishevelled and cross.
                  It' s a curious thing, he said, but the first chap who
                  takes any notice of you when you re carried into hospital is not

                  the doctor but the man from the accounts office who wants to
                  know how you propose to pay for your treatment. No, he said,
                  he didn t really need anything and Chester would arrive shortly,
                  but he was running out of gin. If I'd be an angel and ring
                  up Wild on the Neuer Markt and ask them to send a few bottles out
                  he told me the brand name - that would be splendid.
                  When the friendly voice on the end of the line had repeated
                  the order Ibasked when they would be making their next delivery
                  in the area around Kirchstetten. „Oh but we never deliver out
                  there" said the voice, "We make a special trip for the Herr
                  Professor." Startled, I exclaimed "For goodness sake, that must
                  cost him a packet - you can buy that brand of gin in Böheimkirchen!
                  "Certainly you can" said the voice which now sounded amused,
                  "but why do we have to worry our heads over the way a Herr
                  Professer flings his money around?" I liked the "we".
                  What was so American about the kitchen?
                  When fitted kitchens first came in the Austrians callem
                  them "American" - the term is now as exrinct as "Russian" tea
                  but mast still have been common parlance in Kirchstetten.
                  There was a tidy line-up consisting of fridge, sink, low
                  cupboards providing a good working surface,, a corner fupboard
                  the interior of which swung out, and a gas stove. Both men were
                  very proud of the kitchen and it became Chester s habitat.
                  But the whole point of a modern kitchen: the labour-saving
                  working area, ample storage space, accessibility, was totally
                  cancelled out by the permanent clutter. It was a matter of
                  principle with Chester to have all cooking ingredients conceniently
                  to hand, which meant that nothing was ever put away, and where
                  his loving eye saw method, even the least fussy visitor could
                  only see a shambles. But an interesting shambles owing to the
                  exotic nature of the preserved foods and spices which Chester
                  brought with him. There was  for example a dried leaf which,
                  detected by me in a casserole, was said to have no flavour but
                  to serve as a stimulus or bridge to other flavours.
                  It was clear from the beginning that the two of them were

                  to the enormous fat content of some of the dishes. I remember
                  my horror as I watched a sauce being prepared in the mixer before
                  it was re-heated to accompany the roast duck. It consisted of
                  equal parts of rendered down duck fat and cream, and would have
                  sustained a miner at the coal face for an indefinite period

                  Gentlemen,
                  My position is very simple: one pays income tax where one
                  earns money, that is to say in my case, as a writer writing in
                  English, in the United States and in England. In Austria I
                  earn not one groschen, I merely spend schullings.
                  You maintain that I possess a "material interest" in Austria,
                  by which you presumably mean a "financial" interest. That might
                  conceivably be the case if I had to say to myself: „I must go
                  to Austria because I can only work in Austria!" But that is not
                  the case. I have lived in many places in many different countries
                  and was always able sto work wherever I might be.
                  I naturally have a "pörsonal" interest in Austria, otherwise
                  I should not come here. The landscape is pleasing, and I find
                  the Austrians whose acquaintance I have made, friendly ansd
                  charming.
                  You say correctly that I once received an Austrian prize
                  for lieterature. This was a great honour of which I am very
                  proud. You cannot however serioiusly believe, Gentlemen, that I
                  calculated: "If I continue to go to Austria maybe I shall be
                  given a prize“? Until it was awarded to me I had never heard
                  of  prize. It is equally clear that I cannot receive it a
                  Translation from the German text which is a manuscript, not a
                  letter. An English original is not known to exist and it is
                  assumed that Auden destroyed his draft.

                  second time. You also go on to say that a road in Kirchstetten
                  has been named Audenstraße after me. That was a very kind gesture
                  on the part of the local council, but it cannot be maintaineed
                  that I profit from it financially.
                  Further, you say with truth that I have written several poems
                  Austrian themes. To this I would like to make three
                  statements.
                  1. I have never, in Austria, received so much as one
                  penny for my poems. One or two of them have been trans¬
                  lated into German, but in these cases the translators have
                  received the money, not I.
                  2. I believe you are not clearly aware how poetry comes
                  to be written. What is generally taken to be the subject
                  matter is only a viewpoint, an occasion whereby certain
                  thoughts about nature, God, history, mankind etc. may be
                  expressed which the poet may have had in mind for a very
                  long time. I wrote, for example, a poem to commemorate the
                  20th anniversary of the death of Josef Weinheber.
                  Fundamentally however the poem is concerned with quite
                  different things. First of all it is about the love
                  which every poet, whatever his nationality, has for his
                  mother tongue, and secondly about what happened after the
                  war in the countries which were defeated, i.e. not only
                  in Austria but in Germany and Italy. Again: in 1964
                  I wrote a poem with the title "Whitsunday in Kirchstetten"
                  because it was where I happened to be. But the place is
                  unimportant. In reality the question in this poem is
                  what, for a Christian, is the meaning of the Feast of
                  Pentecost. And this is valid for all countries in the
                  same way.
                  3. I believe you do not clearly recognize a poet's (Dichter
                  financial sktuation. If he is suceessful, a novelist
                  can make a good deal of money. A poet (Lyriker) cannot,
                  even if he is very well known, because he is only read
                  by a minority. By far the greater part of my income
                  comes not from the sale of my volumes of poetry but from
                  book reviews, translations, lectures etc., activities
                  which have nothing to do with Austria. Amd while we are

                  on the subject of translations you rightly say that
                  I have a great intrrest in German and Austrian literatur
                  I may add in music as well - but I do not have to come
                  to Austria in order to read or to hear them.
                  You see feem allxxxx this that the arguments brought
                  forward by you for subjecting me to payment of income tax are not
                  valid. The most pertinent argument against it is that in the
                  course of one year I always stay under six months in Austriaa
                  and never spend more than three months here consecutively.
                  A word in conclusion: if this in my view entirely unjustifiable
                  nonsense does not cease, I shall leave Austria never to return,
                  which would be very sad for me and perhaps too for the shopkeepers
                  of Kirchstetten. One thing, Gentlemen, I cannot conceal from you:
                  if this should happen it mkght give rise to a scandal of worldwide
                  dimensions.
                  W.H. Auden.
                  1 You ask why I have made over my half of our property in
                  Kirchstetten to Mr Chester Kallman who is not related to me.
                  Mr Kallman is my heir. I have no children and for years past
                  he has been my literary collaborator. Sointly, we have written
                  five new opera libretti, "The Rake s Progress, „Elegy for Young
                  Lovers", "The Bassarids" and "Love s Labours Lost". And
                  together we have made new translations of "The MagiccFlute“,
                  "Don Giovanni", „Die Sieben Todsünden", "Mahagonny" and
                  "Archifanfaro". I am now 65 years old and must reckon with all
                  eventualities such as a heart attack. As you know better than
                  I, in the event of sudden death great difficulties arise for the
                  heirs to landed property, particularly in a foreign country.

                  "Every day for the past year" said Chester "I have stood
                  outside his door in the early morning, afraid to go in.'
                  This was later. Now, Auden was dead, the voice issuing
                  from the car radio had just said so. A few days ago we had
                  talked about his reading in the Society for Literature on 28
                  September. Unfortunately, I said, I was obliged to drive to
                  Linz and to spend the nkght there, but they were welcome to use
                  my Vienna flat. It was maddening and I would just as soon
                  put it off. No, said Auden, mustn tdo that, one should stick
                  to one s commitments. "And you won tbe missing much“ he
                  reassured me, "you ve heard it all before." We would meet again
                  in a few days time and then he would tell me all about it. He was
                  not sure about the flatsbut he would let me know in good time.
                  On 24 September he wrote a note to say that he did not need the
                  flat, he would go to the Hotel Altenburgerhof. The handwriting
                  is ragged.
                  Linz already lay far behind, the car radio went on mkuttering
                  to itself unheeded until the familiar voice of Friedrich Hee
                  came through, reading one of his book reviews. It was consoling
                  in a world where, suddenly, a signpost was missing. What are
                  you howling about, I asked myself, what gives you the right to
                  mourn for Wystan? Think of Chester. It was impossible not to
                  think of Chester: it was not so much a question how much he
                  would grieve over the death of Wystan, as how he would survive
                  at all. Leaving the autobahn at St.Pölten I drove straight to
                  Kirchstetten; it seemed to be just possible that he might have
                  arrived in the meantime. But the green shutters were closed
                  and there was no one about apart from the wall-eyed dog, an
                  exceptionally hideous mongrel belonging to Frau Strobl, which
                  barked in an irritating falsetto. He barked from a position close
                  beside me while I wrote a note and stuck it in the chink between
                  the door s shutters, and he was still barking as I shut the
                  garden gate behind me.
                  The answer to my note was a telephone call from Frau Strobl:
                  Herr Kallman said, would I come over to tea the next day?
                  That was the Sunday.

                  The sittingroom seemed to be full of people. Ghester was
                  sitting on the corner-seat facing the door, where Auden always
                  used to sit, every  appeared to be occupied and two young
                  men were sitting on the floor. Chester hurried
                  across the room, hugged me and said "The whole thing sterrible,
                  you have to help me."
                  I was introduced to the others. Mrs. Thekla Clark and her
                  daughter had come up from Florence as soonaas they heard the
                  news; there was Frau Maria Seitz, headmistress of the shool;
                  Herr Enzinger the mayor
                  of Kirchstetten,  film scriptwriter Adolf Opel, and the young men.
                  Clearly, the meeting to discuss the funeral arraggements was
                  not proceeding smoothly. The mayor looked annoyed, Frau Seitz
                  looked worried and Mrs Clark bewildered. There were, of course,
                  language difficulties. Mayor Enzinger spoke not a word of
                  English and the Clarks no German, while the headmistress had a
                  certain command of English but did not feel up to acting as
                  interpreter and adviser in one; Chester a German was perfectky
                  adequate.
                  The root of the problem lay on a deeper level, where two
                  separate cultures collided head on. Chester was barely coherent,
                  but he managed to explain his point of view. He loathed, from
                  the bottom of his hearteverything in the way of pompes funebres.
                  He wanted to bury Auden, he said, quietly and privately and, if
                  it could possibly be managed, on Tuesday. He had already informed
                  Wystsan s brother Dr. John Auden, Stephen Spender and osthers
                  of the arrangements and asked them to arrive, if not tomorrow,
                  then on Tuesday morning at the latest. On the other hand the
                  mayor of Kirchstetten, he went on, wanted to lay on a really big
                  show with brass bands and all the rest of it, and what was more
                  on the Saturday to give as many people as possible the chance to
                  come. The Ministry of Education and the provincial council of
                  Lower Austria were to be represented, and as the last straw the
                  hearse was to drive up to the house. He would not allow any of
                  this, he said: "I can't bear it and I won thave it."
                  Mayor Enzinger drew a deep breath. The first thing we had
                  to realise, he pointed out, was that the body had not yet been

                  released by the authorities. In all cases where the cause of death
                  is not wholly clear certainkformalities are obligatory, and even
                  intervention at a high level would not work miracles. Everything
                  takes time. And how could anyone expect it of him, the Bürgermeister
                  that he should refrain from notifying the Ministry and the Cultural
                  department of the Council of the death of Professor Auden? It
                  was as much as his job was worth. Now Frau Seitz spoke. The
                  inhabitants of Kirchstetten, she believed, would hardly bury a dog
                  in the manner proposed by Herr Kallman, let alone a great poet.
                  Chester Kallman s position was entirely comprehensible - to
                  some of us. To him, an Emerican of Jewish origin and a non-believer,
                  the whole pomp and circumstance of a traditional Austrian funeral
                  was abhorrent. Where prominent personages are concerned, there
                  Ster Appir prato
                  would certainly be the local brass band, and/delegations representing
                  the voluntary fire brigade, the federal railways, the veterans
                  association and others besides, and the gamekeepers would blow
                  their horns and wish him good hunting in the Elysian fields.
                  To Chester s mind such folksy rituals were as foreign as the burial
                  rites of the Incas. He did not know that not very long ago in
                  Lower Austria, Auden as a bachelor would have been accompanied in
                  the funeral procession by a "bride" dressed in white. He was
                  unable to understand that his intentions were an intolerable affront
                  to the population of Kirchstetten. In his despair, it certainly
                  never occurred to him that Auden himself would very likely have
                  been entranced at the idea of a slap-up funeral with all the
                  trimmings - one can almost hear his Olympian laughter - followed
                  by a hearty meal at the inn where he had so often aud his lunch.
                  As it turned out, Chester got no marks in local opinion for this
                  finale either, as the meal consisted of Leberkäs with vegetables:
                  fried slices offa loaf of a flabby substance related to the
                  Frankfurter sausage (which is neither liver nor cheese. It is a
                  homely, juicy meal all too familiar to every Austrian; and it is
                  cheap. There would bex much talk of this also after all was over
                  For their part, the local people were forgetting that Chester was
                  probably in financial straits - not that this would have been taken
                  as an excuse.
                  For a moment the discussion had come to a standstill.

                  fetched more beer, Frau Strobl walked in and out and rolled a
                  baleful eye on us as she spoke into Chester s ear.
                  The points at issue were not only When and How Much; there
                  was also the matter of the church service and the prayers at the
                  graveside. Many people in Akustria had assumed Auden to be of the
                  Roman Catholic faith; he had of course remained a:member of the
                  Anglican and Episcopalian churnes. The misunderstanding arose
                  from his regular attendance at mass in the parish church and his
                  friendly relationship with Father Lustkandl, the parish priest
                  referred to in „Whitsunday in Kirchstetten“. Auden asked
                  Lustkandles sucessor for permission to be buried in the churchyard,
                  and his wish was acceded to. Telogical thing to do, then,
                  was to approach the chaplain to the British Embassy in Vienna,
                  the Revd. Bruce Duncan, and ask him to officiate. What form of
                  service this should be - there could be no question of a funeral
                  mass - left everyone present at a loss. We agreed at last that
                  it ought to be some kind of ecumenical ceremony held jointly by
                  the two clergymen, but that first of all, the plan must be put
                  before Do John Auden.
                  At this juncture Chester Kallman withdrew his insistence on
                  xx the impossibly early date for the
                  funeral. The room had become much too warm, the oxygen was
                  running out and Chester would not be able to stand much more
                  pressure. The most urgent x objective waslquite simply to
                  free him from our burdensome presence. Once everyone had agreed
                  that Auden s relations must be told immediately that the funeral
                  had been postponed, the moment had come to dissolve the meeting.
                  Mrs Clark undertook to telephone to London and Frau Strobl would
                  drive her to the Post Office. Chester asked me to talk everything
                  over with Frau Seitz and Herr Enzinger and reach definite conclu¬
                  sions. We all stood up, Chester came across the room to me and
                  spoke in an undertone. He was completely exhausted, he said,
                  he couldn t stand much more. "I'll do anything you want, you
                  must just try to hold the others in check." Finally he said
                  "It 11 be all right, I'm crammed full of tranquillizers, all I
                  need is a bit of a rest." He embraced me warmly and left the room.

                  the chief mourners. It was "he-whose-name-we-never-mention";
                  or if it was, Chester had said, Auden crossed himself.
                  At the lowest point in Kirchstetten where the roads divide
                  thr procession halted while the coffin was transferred from the
                  hearse to a hand-drawn bier. At this point the Church took charge
                  and the procession resumed its steady pace; photographs exist
                  which were taken during the brief interval.
                  To British ears quite unremarkable, the ecumenickà service
                  was much talked about in Akstrian circles because nothing of the
                  kind had been known before. The Revd. Bruce Duncan, today Rector
                  of Crediton in Devon, can remember little x about the general
                  circumstances but confirms that he used the Book of Common Prayer
                  and the long reading from the first of St.Paul to the
                  Coringhians, chapter 15, verses 20-58. Beyond that, all he recalls
                  x ishis difficulties with Chester.
                  Reaching for my Authorised Version, for surely no one would
                  have dared to use any other, on second thoughts I also took out the
                  New Testament as translated into German by Martin Luther. After
                  reading the English text through vely slowly, and then a second
                  time, I did the same with the Lutheran Bible and lost in thought
                  compared the two, verse by verse.
                  "How nice to see you" said Auden who was sitting on one of the
                  white garden chairs with the red covers, "it s a bit einsam here.
                  And I wanted to write and tell you that the technical word for
                  buddle is Erzwaschtrog. I hope there is an equivalent German
                  euphemism for'senior citizen. Oh and adit is stollen, and although
                  I may be wrong, I guess concentrating mill is Vereinigungsmühle."
                  'What a mercy you ve told me" I said, relieved. "I should have
                  to have dug up such frightful words in the British Council library.
                  But do you think people will understand all that about the primary
                  and secondary worlds, or will they get muddled?"
                  "It s perfectly simple" said Auden. "The initial impulse to
                  create a secondary world is a feeling of awe aroused by encounters,
                  in the primary world, with sacred beings or events."
                  "There is one glory of the sun" I heard myself say, "and
                  another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars: for on

                  star differeth from another in glory.'
                  "Ah" he said, "you ve been reading Corinthians One, chapter 15.
                  Let us eat and drink; for tomorrow we die.' Chester and I took
                  that bidding rather too literally."
                  "Who would know where that familiar quotation comes from?
                  I wondered.
                  "I would" said Auden. "I ve been looking up the German text.
                  Have you ever compared the Authosized Version with Martin Luther?"
                  "Funny you should ask that" I said. "It' s one of the things
                  I forgot to talk to you about. Be not deceived: evilcommmica-
                  tions corrupt good manners. He renders that as Lasset euch nicht
                  verführen! Böse Geschwätze verderben gute Sitten.'
                  "Very neat" said Auden happily. I like 'evil chatter
                  better than communications'."
                  "The publishers" Isaid "have a rather heavy-handed way of
                  printing the more quotable bits in bold-face. But in the next
                  verse Luther seems to flounder. Werdet doch einmal recht nüchtern
                  und sündiget nicht!“ Do be a bit sober for once, he pleads. And
                  sin not. King James s translators fancied that St Paul cried out
                  SAwake to righteousness!'
                  "Who knows what he really said."
                  "Luther' s language is very fine as he reaches the climxx:
                  Siehe, ich sage euch ein Geheimnis... '"
                  But Auden was speaking. „Behold, I shew you a mystery:
                  we shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed, In a moment,
                  in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet
                  shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we
                  shall be changed.“ And with e vanished. Now wide awake, I
                  put the two books back on their shelf and settled down to re-type
                  Auden s speech at Neulengbach.
                  Sehr verehrter Herr Landeshauptmann, Ladies and gentlemen:
                  I hope you will pardon me if I speak somewhat personally. I do so,
                  not out of vanity...
