                  Lunch with W.H.A. at the Opern-Cafe on<lb/>
                  13th Feb.1958.
               </p>
               <p>
                  Talk of awful impasse in Vietnam<lb/>
                  War; W. so afraid of use of nuclear<lb/>
                  weapons that he can hardly bear to<lb/>
                  read or listen to the news. Feels US<lb/>
                  will have --- --- ---; perhaps to<lb/>
                  blame for the "Pueblo" affair &amp; ---<lb/>
                  in territorial waters.<lb/>
                  May have to vote Republican. ---<lb/>
                  he's never done --- before, because the<lb/>
                  Democrats --- --- --- are for<lb/>
                  President.<lb/>
                  Says the Hippies are wearing in on<lb/>
                  his district, I asked what a hippy<lb/>
                  does when he gets old; W. said thats'<lb/>
                  what he asks them; too soon to tell.<lb/>
                  Told him about Hundertwasser &amp;<lb/>
                  his naked protests.<lb/>
                  I said I was glad he had told<lb/>
                  British young people that L.S.D is<lb/>
                  a dead duck for creative workers.<lb/>
                  W. told cue of some length about<lb/>
                  his trails of LSD &amp; mescalin,<lb/>
                  Point is that young people need<lb/>
                  to discover who &amp; what they are -
               </p>
            <pb facs="https://iiif.acdh.oeaw.ac.at/amp/amp_0216/" type="sheet"/>
               <p>
                  &amp;LSD doen't tell them, its' a<lb/>
                  passive effect in which there is<lb/>
                  alienation from self. You concentrate<lb/>
                  on things (chair, ceiling ---),people<lb/>
                  become unimportant. ---<lb/>
                  effect of listening to music -<lb/>
                  intolerable as the sounds lose<lb/>
                  their interrelation &amp; form.<lb/>
                  Basically, you achieve a mild<lb/>
                  degree of schizophrenia. Huxley<lb/>
                  did a --- of harm by publishing<lb/>
                  his experiences with mescalin,<lb/>
                  making people think it is<lb/>
                  an artistic experience. W.<lb/>
                  had to add colour effects.<lb/>
                  Awful story about young people<lb/>
                  having gone blind was invented -<lb/>
                  --- ---. He did it in<lb/>
                  company with his doctor and<lb/>
                  they went round to --- ---.<lb/>
                  Suddenly saw a postman waving<lb/>
                  at him &amp; thought "this is it".<lb/>
                  Later postman said "I waved<lb/>
                  at you, why didn't you answer?"

                  Talked with great enthusiasm<lb/>
                  about "Mayhew." Said this is the<lb/>
                  greatest work of the 19th century.<lb/>
                  Has --- --- new issue<lb/>
                  in 4 --- in the New Yorker.<lb/>
                  Said how well it pays to do<lb/>
                  a lecture/reading tour. In<lb/>
                  6 weeks --- --- clear 15,000 $.<lb/>
                  But it's "killing" - the ---<lb/>
                  --- which you can't ---. And<lb/>
                  if you do meet someone<lb/>
                  interesting you're torn apart<lb/>
                  after --- 3 minutes.<lb/>
                  W. hat flown over for 4 days<lb/>
                  to interview couple for Kirchstetten,<lb/>
                  --- to return to N.Y.
