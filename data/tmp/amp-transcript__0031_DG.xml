                <p>
                    Dear Ed,
                </p>
                <p>
                    <space quantity="4" unit="char"/>The time has come to send out a signal to you from this<lb/>
                    ancient, scandal-ridden, provincial dump. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>Peter Müller has<lb/>
                    not been sleeping over his plan to edit a book on Auden´s<lb/>
                    time here, he has been writing books himself in addition to<lb/>
                    his full time profession. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>Now - you may know this - it is<lb/>
                    definite and the book is to come out in February 1987 in<lb/>
                    time for A´s 80th.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <space quantity="4" unit="char"/>So he got me back to my desk, to, in his words, combine<lb/>
                    my English and German texts, and bring the whole thing up to<lb/>
                    date. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>"Write as fully as you can, double the length." <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>I<lb/>
                    protested that a) I don´t wish to chatter more feebly than I<lb/>
                    have already, b) I am ancient and frail, also lazy, c) the<lb/>
                    first MSS only approximate to each other while containing m<del><gap reason="illegible"/></del>kuch<lb/>
                    the same material; <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>their tone differs. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>But above all they<lb/>
                    have, whether bad or indifferent, a certain shape or form and<lb/>
                    you cannot just stuff more material into it which refers to<lb/>
                    things which hap<del>e</del>pened subsequently. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>So we agreed that we would<lb/>
                    leave the texts to stand and that I would say, roughly, okay,<lb/>
                    that was how it looked then; <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>what has happened since, what<lb/>
                    is there still be said by us, who knew Auden in Kirchstetten<lb/>
                    in view of the fact that Carpenter did no research on this<lb/>
                    location<unclear>s</unclear>? <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>For a long time the idea was only to write a<lb/>
                    German text, I mean that the book would be sol<del>t´</del>ely German<lb/>
                    l<del>n</del>anguage production, and this I thought until quite recently.<lb/>
                    Suddenly, Peter bounced me with the comment that he would<lb/>
                    "like an English version as well." <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>I had thought my two texts<lb/>
                    were only to be combined and the sequel written in German.<lb/>
                    This presents technical problems. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>For example, and now my<lb/>
                    questions to you begin:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <space quantity="4" unit="char"/>We ihave here a copy of Auden´s declaration to the tax<lb/>
                    authorities. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>(I have been determined all along that this<lb/>
                    document should be published AND RIGHT HERE. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>Apart from making<lb/>
                    Them look stupid, it must be unique in literary history that a<lb/>
                    great poet should explain to the tax authorities how poetry<lb/>
                    comes to be written.) <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>Do you have the English original, or where<lb/>
                    is it;  did it ever exist or was the German drafted by Auden<lb/>
                    and put together by, s<del>y</del>ay, his lawyer? <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>Or could this have been<lb/>
                    done by whoever it was who wrote the prose version of the<lb/>
                    Weinheber poem? <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>I have that text which A. gave me, but there<lb/>
                    is no record of who wrote it. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>In my first dr<del>s</del>aft of the talk<lb/>
                    given at the PEN Club in London in 1976 I wrote: "I have the<lb/>
                    statement in German translation, so that what I am reading is<lb/>
                    my own re-translation back into English and not the original.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <space quantity="4" unit="char"/>I should be very grateful if you could help me over the<lb/>
                    address which Auden held at Neulengbach. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>I have the original<lb/>
                    English text which to my horror Auden asked me to translate:<lb/>
                    although capable of creative writing in German, to deal with<lb/>
                    this tough text was too m<del>k</del>uch and it was corrected by my husband.<lb/>
                    Müller possesses the German text taken from a tape. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>Now this<lb/>
                    English text is so familia<del>s</del>rrto me that it deafens me to all<lb/>
                    or any sources. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>A digest of it is in the PEN text but I wonder
                </p>

                    - 2 -<lb/>
                    to what extent Auden´s speech contains hitherto unknown material,<lb/>
                    if any. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>I said air<del>l</del>ily that he had probably said i<del>a</del>t a<del>s</del>ll before,<lb/>
                    in Secondary Worlds and so on, but this is not true. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>After a<lb/>
                    preamble the speech begins:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <space quantity="4" unit="char"/>Between the ages of six and twelve, I spent a great many of<lb/>
                    <space quantity="4" unit="char"/> my waking hours in the fabrication of a private secondary<lb/>
                    s <space quantity="2" unit="char"/>sacred world, the basic elements of which were a) a limestone<lb/>
                    landscape mainly derived from the Pennine Moors in the North of<lb/>
                    <space quantity="4" unit="char"/>England and b) an industry - lead-mining.<lb/>
                    <space quantity="4" unit="char"/>I<del>r</del>t is no doubt psychologically significant that my sacred<lb/>
                    <space quantity="4" unit="char"/>world was autistic - that is to say I had no wish to share<lb/>
                    <space quantity="4" unit="char"/>it with others ... <space quantity="2" unit="char"/>and so on.
                 </p>
                <p>
                    He goes on to define the Primary and Secondary Worlds; <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>his<lb/>
                    private world, the restrictions on the freedom of the artist;<lb/>
                    water-turbines, his Platonic idea of a concentrating mill and<lb/>
                    of his moral duty to sacrifice his aesthetic <del>princip </del>preference<lb/>
                    to reality or truth.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <space quantity="4" unit="char"/>If you like I can have the whole thing photo-copied and<lb/>
                    send it along, but you see what it´s about. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>I cannot believe<lb/>
                    that Wystan chose Neulengbach to make a one-time-only<lb/>
                    statement of this length and weight, the idea is absurd and<lb/>
                    the point of my quotation in my talk in 1976 was to show Auden<lb/>
                    in one aspect of his contact with the Austrians, not without<lb/>
                    a touch of hilarity. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>But this is not in Secondary Worlds,<lb/>
                    I have leafed through your Early Auden page by page and finkd<lb/>
                    no reference, nor can I find it anywhere else. <space quantity="1" unit="char"/>Can you<lb/>

                 </p>

                    goes iknto my new piece, and incidentally the contributions<lb/>

                    If so it would be nice to know about it so I can refer to it.

                <p>
                    <space quantity="4" unit="char"/>The chaplain sto the British Embassy in Vienna gave me the<lb/>

                    This would be of interest here because though common practice<lb/>
                    in England such an ecumenical service was a novelty here and<lb/>
                    caused much comment.
